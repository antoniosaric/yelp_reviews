1,Edwin R.,"Service here was amazing.  On point. My corned beef hash was delicious. I special ordered a side of fresh fruits instead of hash brown.

I dined here during lunch with my colleagues and even though they were super busy,  our waiter paid equal attention to all the tables including ours, and refilled our water before they were half empty.  Amazing! Great place for large groups or for two. Highly recommend.

2,D D.,"Located across the street from an old folks home, old folks comprise the majority of their clientele. That's a fun fact for you to keep in your back pocket. Or front pocket. Just don't keep it in the little pocket that's inside your front pocket. What's that for anyway, gum?

Anyway this place has great food and even better service. Prices are reasonable.",4.0,2019-08-31,0.712,0.153,0.135,63
3,Randy B.,"This location in San Bruno feels like an coffee shop / deli.  The menu has lots of nice choices: burgers, sandwiches, salads, pastas, and entrees (pot roast, fish & chips, meatloaf).  Plus, Greek items such as Spanakopita, Zucchini Cakes, and Avgolemono soup -- all of which I have to try.

But since it's deli-inspired, I went with the Reuben (not really a hard sell with me):

Can I say it was excellent?  Yes.  Yes I can!
==================================
REUBEN SANDWICH hot corned beef, sauerkraut, thousand island dressing, melted swiss cheese, grilled marble rye

Tender and thinly sliced lean meat with all the right stuff.  Sure, it was a little greasy from the grill, but really hit the spot (mine, in particular).  I upgraded to the garlic oregano fries for many ""ooh la la"" moments, one fry at a time.

Go back chance = 82%

I think I'll be heading here, again, and to other Jack locations.",4.0,2019-08-29,0.669,0.308,0.023,156
4,Amy Y.,"Came here for a baby shower and pre reserved the space. I heard they were very sweet about reserving spaces. We got a bottle of champagne, and some food. I tried the buffalo chicken salad with ranch which was pretty good. The restaurant itself seems fancy on the outside and when you walk in, it gives you a more casual feel than BJ's. There's plenty of lighting inside so it's not dark. They have booths and chair seats available. 

Overall the experience was okay. Parking can be hard to find but there is a big patch of land that you can park and walk over. Prices were mediocre to higher side given quality of food.",3.0,2019-08-22,0.599,0.344,0.057,115

7,Stacie J.,This restaurant was busy. It had a few large parties getting down on the food. It could have been just what I ordered but my spaghetti was bland and needed salt. Even after I added salt it was still just ok. I tasted the Mac and Cheese and once you added salt the flavors and the consistency were both there.,3.0,2019-08-10,0.011,0.037,0.952,60
8,Jesse S.,"My service today was with Robert,  Robert is a great wait person,  checking up on us to see if we needed anything.  Not to often just right. 
Even if he wasn't around other staff was able help. 
We started with reservations. A must unless you have time to wait outside in the rain and cold. The bar might be ok if you want to feel like a sardine in a can. Music was loud near the bar , so I would ask for a booth away from the bar. 
Food the good stuff, Italian sausage with penne pasta. A good choice. Portions large , tasty and filling. We also had the fruits of the sea pasta plate. Now this is a dish you don't want to share , you want to keep it all for yourself, if you have leftovers its better the next day. Not that it will last long. 
We slipped out of dessert too full.
We will come back!",4.0,2019-06-01,0.35,0.39,0.261,162
9,Cindy T.,"My first time going to Jacks for breakfast. From eggs Benedict to waffles, you will find something to your taste. I had the Greek scramble which had a lot of gyro meat and feta cheese. I asked for extra crispy hash browns which were so good. The sour dough toast was made with sour dough bread instead of French bread. The wait staff was friendly and came back multiple times to see if we needed anything.  The only draw back is the dirt and rock overflow parking lot.",4.0,2019-10-05,0.24,0.34,0.42,88
10,Bradley H.,"I can't believe that I haven't written a review on this place yet!  Jack's has been around forever and I absolutely love their comfort style food. Nothing super fancy, just good home cook style meals. The staff here are always friendly and the place is big enough that there is never much of a wait to get in if any.

 My favorites include just the but everything I have tried at this place...everything is just very solid, from the breakfast through the lunch and dinner...there isnt a bad choice.

My absolute favorite is the Reuben...for breakfast, lunch, or dinner...love the grilled bun and all the cheese and meat just melded together...makes my mouth water just thinking about it.  Throw on the usual side of fries that is included, and you have a hearty meal that won't disappoint!

12,Benjamin P.,"What's there not to love about Jack's? 

Vibrant atmosphere. Caring staff. Ridiculously fast service. Quality menu. Tasty food. 

I love their hash browns. Breakfast is my go to meal when I come here. Omelettes are good as well. Try the moose, which is awesome -hash browns, biscuit, sausage, gravy, and some other good stuff. Probably my fav think I've had here. 

Reuben is also good and the fries are tasty restaurant quality fries. 

I look forward to exploring more of their menu. 

I try and limit eating here to only once per week, but at times I'm drawn back more frequently.",5.0,2019-02-14,0.78,0.145,0.074,101
13,Alyssa N.,"I frequent Jack's during their breakfast hours on the weekends with my family. Even when it's busy our party of 5 doesn't have too long of a wait during peak hours. When I come with my mom or my bf we usually sit at the bar area which seats faster than a table and it's first come first serve.

I'm a basic breakfast eater and my go to order is, 2 eggs any style with hashbrowns and toast with coffee. 

Pros:
- Attentive waiters and hostess
- Food comes out fairly quickly 
- Consistency of quality of food is excellent 
- I love all the natural light from the windows. It makes the ambiance more inviting.
- They decorate the interior with photos of kids. Not sure if it's the owners family or restaurant eaters but it's super cute and makes the place homey. 

Cons:
- I'm not super intrigued by their dinner menu. I've come here once at night and ordered from the happy hour menu but there are other restaurants I'd go to for appetizers and drinks. 
- Parking can be tricky but there is an open lot next door.

18,Lupe C.,"Food is ok. Got the corned beef hash with a banana foster toast. The beef on the corned beef hash did not taste homemade. It reminded me of the can. They said it's homemade, but I think the only thing that is homemade that they add to it is the onions, peppers, and potato. 

Other than that, food is ok and customer service was fine.",3.0,2019-08-04,0.094,0.241,0.665,65
19,Katrina C.,"I joined my friend and her daughter for breakfast at Jack's, which is their usual breakfast/brunch spot. We arrived around 10am. Despite there being a few parties ahead of us, the wait was pretty short. We got buzzed for our table in 5 minutes after checking in with the hostess. 

Our server was attentive and super nice. Her bubbly personality was especially contagious. She happened to cheer me up while I was trying to nurse my hangover. I also appreciated how she asked my friend's daughter directly what she wanted to eat as opposed to asking my friend to answer for her. 

I ordered the corned beef hash with over easy eggs and side of whole wheat toast. The corned beef hash was fine, but I've certainly had better corned beef hash elsewhere. I liked the peppers and onions mixed in with the corned beef, but I thought it was too dry and overcooked. 

Initially I was going to order The Hangover given my state of being that morning. I should've listened to my gut. No pun intended. My friend ordered The Hangover, which is her go-to, and it was way better than my corned beef hash. When I tried it, I thought it was very much like having a taco for breakfast. I highly recommend The Hangover, and I would totally get it for myself next time as well.",3.0,2018-12-03,0.581,0.303,0.116,230
20,Ash K.,"Great spot for breakfast. I've past this place so many times and had no idea they even served breakfast.

Had the two by two by two - two eggs, two pancakes, and two pieces of meat of your choice (bacon, sausage, chicken-apple sausage or ham) with a side of hash browns. Everything was served hot and was delicious.
The pancakes were huge and fluffy, and the sausages were so good I ordered an extra side.

Service was great in the beginning, but was a little nonexistent during the later part of our visit when we decided we wanted extra servings, boxes, etc. Prices seemed comparable to IHOP. Definitely wanting to come back for lunch and dinner.",3.0,2018-11-12,0.101,0.121,0.778,116
21,Sistine M.,"Came for a family dinner. Probably my 4th time at this location over the last couple years. I tried the pot roast this time. Good choice except it was alllllllost on the borderline of salty. The meat was tender, mashed potatoes were good. I liked that the veggies were crunchy, not over cooked. A lot of people go with their Mac and cheeses, which are all good, btw. The fried chicken is good too. I've found the salmon orzo is too oily for my liking. Tortilla soup is scrumptious! Their Greek lemony soup is good too.

23,Arnie C.,"Just got out of the airport and my family from out of town wanted a place to eat brunch. Jack's definitely hits the spot. We were a party of 7 and was immediately seated, no wait, on a Monday morning around 10 am. Drinks were served quickly, and refills consistently met. Did not take long at all as some reviewers experienced. Food quality was also pretty good. A step up from Denny's for sure when it comes to quality and speed. Only reason this isn't a 5 star review is because theres definitely room for improvement on the food itself. But if you're looking for a good brunch spot near the airport, this is the place to be. Bonus, this place is also a bar so if you're craving mimosas to go along with brunch, then head over to Jacks.",4.0,2019-04-17,0.613,0.246,0.14,140
24,Shayla H.,"I came in to enjoy a drink of simple appetizers before heading to the airport. Just a pita bread and dip sampler and fries. Nothing extensive. Waited 30 min after ordering before the waiter says ""oh you ordered food?"" Then goes to check the system and comes back and says ""oh, well its in the system, but they havent started it yet, we are changing the dishes right now"". Okay...tell me that before then. As a waiter, check on your orders. Very polite man, but needs to step it up as far as following up with order status. There is only 5 tables of seated people right now, and one of them had the wrong food brought to her and she had to wait for the correct plate to be made. It is not busy by any means. Other staff are standing around talking and joking. I am not impressed. The bartender made a great drink though, so thank you to her. Otherwise.

I was seated immediately, service was quick, and my food came out fast. I ordered the farmers market frittata (egg whites and veggies) with hash browns and it was quite tasty! LOVED the hash browns which were perfectly browned and crispy.

27,Reyn J.,"We chose Jack's for the location for our Sunday night dinner for four.

I had the lamb chops. They were charbroiled and cooked to order. With them was Yukon potatoes, but I also had to try the fries. All were delicious. 

The service was warp speed, and it was very good, too. They didn't offer Coke Zero, but asked if Pepsi No Sugar would suffice (?!). We ordered a pinot, and they were out of that particular bottle. We ordered a Cabernet instead.

For a first time visit, it was a fine experience. We'd made a reservation and it was honored, leapfrogging about 30 people that didn't have a reservation. It made me feel guilty but lucky!

37,Ali O.,"This is a very nice restaurant with a nice atmosphere. It is not cozy however as it is very large, so if you want to take a date out for a quiet dinner, this isn't the place. People usually come here with their families so sometimes kids can be loud, and usually large groups also visit and can be very loud. 

Usually there's a wait on Friday and Saturday night after 6pm. The bar however is very nice and they have really nice happy hour specials. The service is also very nice where the wait staff always has a smile on their faces. I do feel however the greeters at the door can be a little nicer, I understand they have to constantly deal with people, but they should try and smile more. 

I always try the Mediterranean platter dinner portion, it's $16 but is plenty of food. Recently I tried the chicken skewers and on the side it came with humus, pita bread, tabouleh and yogurt. The chicken was cooked to perfection, it was very juicy.

38,Anita L.,"Well, since it's been 6 years and all, I figured it was time to give Jack's another try. I was very pleasantly surprised by my visit the second time around. We only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table of 2 and got seated in a nice booth in the back. We decided to start off with the spanakopita which was pretty tasty. The only complaint was that it was a little cold in the middle so could have been heated up longer (or better yet, made fresh, but that's probably a little too much to ask for). 

For our entrees, the bf and I were really feeling salads so I got the shrimp louie with extra bay shrimp while he got the cobb salad. Both of us were pretty happy with our meals. My shrimp louie was light and refreshing and was a large enough portion to last me through lunch and dinner. 

For dessert, we ordered the vanilla bean greek yogurt panna cotta to go. Even though it was a take out order, the staff still plated it beautifully so it looked like what it would have plated in the restaurant. The dessert was tart and light with just a hint of sweetness that was well balanced. 

On top of everything, our waitress was awesome. She was super on top of it and made sure we had everything we needed throughout our meal.",4.0,2018-06-03,0.291,0.374,0.335,237

We got seated quickly. It wasn't too loud so we were able to have a conversation without yelling. 

The service was quick and efficient. The food was fine, nothing spectacular. A couple of things worth noting. My friend likes her scrambled eggs well done, and her toast brown. She said this was the only place, in recent memory, that got it right. Her eggs weren't the least bit runny or overly moist, and the toast was nicely browned and crunchy.

41,Rich H.,"Had dinner with a friend on Saturday night before catching movie at Tanforan. I've only eaten at Jack's twice. The first was many years ago for lunch and I don't remember the experience. The second was for breakfast last year, and it was very good. So after considering a few places in San Bruno, we decided on Jack's. I was craving a burger and fries and this was a good choice.

The wait was reasonable (less than 30 minutes) at the height of the dinner rush, and we relaxed in the bar and had some drinks. We got lucky and grabbed the very last two open seats. A wait is always better in the bar where you can have a beer or a cocktail and chat. Our bartender was busy, but got to us within ten minutes of sitting. I had a Stella and the lady had a Pomegranate in a pear tree, which was a mix of Grey Goose, pomegranate juice, muddled basil and a few other things that I can't remember. It was quite good and the basil gave it an interesting twist.

After being sat, we both dived into the menu hoping to place our orders quickly as we both starving. The place was packed and our server Joseph introduced offered to bring out some bread and glasses of water. By the time he came back, we were ready to order. We started out with the fried calamari. I had the Jack's Burger (Thousand Island Dressing, sauteed onions and American cheese). I wanted something simple. My friend had the California burger (sauteed mushrooms, avocado and jack cheese). I think the next time I go, I'm going for that. 

The fried calamari was good--not great--but we finished the entire plate. It was served with a Chipotle tartar sauce and a cocktail sauce; both were good. Being very hungry makes me less critical, so I will say that I might not order it again, unless the rest of my party wanted it. Still, I would rate it above average.

The Jack's Burger was very good. I could tell the moment our server set the plates in front of us. The aroma of good quality beef is unimistakable and awesome. You just don't get that from even the better fast food joints (i.e Five Guys, In & Out, etc.). The burger itself was just what I was looking for: simple and delicious. I realized it after the first bite. The beef was tender and lean. I love Thousand Island Dressing on a burger and I'm not sure if they make their own or not, but it was pretty awesome. 

My friend enjoyed her burger as much as I did mine and we even ordered a second round of drinks--Stella again for me and Rasberry Lemon Drop for her. By the time we finished them, I was so relaxed I almost forgot about the movie. It was only when Joseph asked us about dessert that snapped me out of my reverie. He was attentive throughout our meal even though he had a lot of tables. Bravo.

42,C B.,"So firat of all, we regularly go here for breakfast.  Today our server was Hya, I hope I spelled that correctly.  She definitely deserves a 5 star, as do most of the servers we've ever had.

Today though I had to temper my rating with the food.  We ordered the Carnivore Omelette and a full stack of blueberry pancakes.  The omelette was good, but the pancakes were very dense. Not fluffy or soft, but dense.  

A steak knife would have been more aapropriate.  We cut the pancakes and then had to tear it apart.  I put a fork in it and lifted the whole pancake on the side intact with a fork.  It did not tear, it was solid, and I already placed syrup on it, which I thought would soften it.

They replaced our pancakes being told that they had a few concerns from others about them this weekend.  When the replacement pancakes came out, it was more dense than the first.   One bite and we decided to not eat them and just leave it at that.  The supervisor asked if we wanted another order, and we decided that we were there long enough.

The highlight of today's breakfast, sourdough toast and the carnivore omelette were both good.  Pancakes not.  Would we come back?  Yes.  Jacks is worth giving another chance.  Just this one time they disappointed.  Service though 5 stars.",3.0,2019-06-23,0.328,0.231,0.441,232

54,Sherille S.,"Have always noticed this place across the mall and finally decided to try something different. It always looked busy, but we didn't have any problems getting a nice booth in the back. Nice size restaurant and they have a lot of booths which is a plus especially when trying to contain kids.

Service: Five stars just for the service!  I was very impressed with our server Joseph and his crew. He acknowledged us right away with some waters and brought us piping hot sourdough bread. I thought the bread was really good btw and they served it hot, which is a pet peeve when they don't. He was really personable and knew how to deal with the impatient kids. Just little touches that were appreciated like bringing small cups with lids, making sure to clear away old dishes, replacing any needed silverware, extra napkins, bringing out the kids' food first, checking in how we were doing. Things you think should be standard with service, but unfortunately is not at most restaurants.

Food: Good, but nothing that was spectacular. May have to try more items. Portions were really huge and we had enough for a meal the next day. Tried the zucchini cakes and they needed more salt, probably wouldn't have again, but the kids liked it. Might try the wings next time because they looked good. Had the early bird chicken breast and salmon. Comes with a choice of soup or salad, veggies, choice between mashed potatoes or cracked wheat pilaf, and a drink. Had never had that kind of pilaf ( kind of wish it was just the standard rice), so went the safe route with the mashed potatoes. Expected more flavor. I actually liked their coffee since it was stronger than at usual restaurants. Joseph was also nice enough to bring me a fresh cup for my second serving and he didn't skimp on creamers. Had the banana split for dessert and it was impressive. Would have liked real hot fudge.

Overall, wonderful service and great for kids. Would come here again and try other dishes. Will also have to see how brunch is.",5.0,2018-01-18,0.365,0.197,0.438,356

59,Peter B.,"Just our luck,  the main draw getting us to choose Jacks , I had a hankering to try their Banana Fosters French toast. My daughter and I planned to share it. We ordered Omelettes, that were good.
Our food was delivered. Expecting the French toast to bring up the rear. 5 mins later, I got the attention of a bus-boy. French-toast?
Another waiter came over.
Banana Foster French toast! ?
My waitress was nowhere to be seen. By the way we never saw her again until we were walking out.
We were told French toast coming right up.
10 mins later, the waiter apparently now taking over for our waitress, made a specific trip to our table to see if our missing breakfast entree showed.
It hadn't, we called it off. 
I despise waiters/waitresses that let this happen.
It's bad for the owners, the reputation, the dismal tip that's left coinciding with their efforts.

The place seems to be always pretty full, but I've never had a crazy long wait. I like to get the meatloaf. It is topped with onion rings! I am also not ashamed to say that I love their hot dog mac n cheese. Fish and chips is not too shabby either. 

Their pumpkin bread pudding was a miss for me. The taste was on point but the consistency was off. It was too thin and watery, like the custard did not set properly. Our table also shared the chocolate cake. I don't like chocolate (crazy right?) so I didn't try it, but the rest of my table thoroughly enjoyed that. 

I've always had spot on service. They're friendly and patient even when I think my table is being snobby and annoying.",3.0,2017-08-21,0.137,0.188,0.675,159

Walked in and they seated our group immediately. Service was fast and friendly so no complaints on that part. 

For a drink I ordered their strawberry lemonade. It was tasty. I can't remember if there were free refills on it or not. For food I started off with their Cesar salad, which was standard. For my entree I got their Italian Mac (asiago, mozzarella, mild italian sausage, sun-dried tomatoes, basil, chili flakes), but asked for chicken instead and they were happy to accommodate me. It was one of the best mac and cheeses I've ever had. I honestly can't wait to go back and have it again. My boyfriend got the shrimp scampi.

On first glance, the menu seems modern, almost edgy with unusual choices like chili mac 'n cheese.  But then I realize it's pretty conventional.  Good for families, because you know what you're getting.  I had a Greek Salad.  One tomato was spoiled and blackened!  The waiter was unimpressed.  Otherwise it was a normal American greek salad with not too much dressing. 
Last time I visited, I tried a Tuscan Sandwich for lunch.  It was good, but bland.  It needs something to make it great.  
Atmosphere is good; you almost forget it's in a strip mall.  
Service is average.  Not overly attentive or helpful.  Decent.  
If it were cheaper, I might visit again.  But I try to avoid it.

We were still ignored. My husband caught a bartender's eye and said we'd like to order drinks. He didnt come over, but listened to our orders, then went to attend others away from the bar.

Walking up to the restaurant, you'd never know that there would be so much going on behind the tinted windows, but as you step in, this restaurant and bar is completely buzzing with activity.

Classic American comfort foods dominate the menu, but Jack's also has a curiously large selection of Mediterranean-inspired dishes. For dinner, I tried the chicken souvlaki platter, which came with juicy, delicious chicken skewers, creamy tzatziki, grilled triangles of pita, tabbouleh, and olives. I also had the Thai steak salad, which came with thin slices of grilled flank steak on a bed of napa cabbage, carrots, bell pepper, cilantro, basil, mint, and crispy rice noodles! The flavors of both of these dishes were simply yet delicious. The casual atmosphere with tons of large groups and families really adds to the experience, and our server was so hospitable and attentive to boot.

It came out perfect and was delicious. The servers and waiters provided great service for our group of 15.

70,Joe R.,"I was in the Bay Area with Ron and Denise over the weekend, and after arriving we decided to have dinner at Jack's. We'd seen it from the El Camino before and talked about trying it on a future trip, so this was out opportunity. 

Parking is quite challenging, Jack's lot is small and shared with other stores in the strip shopping center it is located in. There is a unpaved lot adjacent to the restaurant, which is where we ended up parking. 

The wait was reasonable, probably because I went on Jack's website and reserved our table about an hour and a half prior to arriving. 

Our server JLO came by our table to take our drink order and shortly took our entree order. I have the early bird chicken piccata and both Ron and Denise had the chicken asiago. My dinner came with choice of house salad or soup, where Ron and Denise's did not. They were charged $4.95 for a dinner salad. 

The chicken piccata was a generous portion, the sucre with capers was more creamy than I've had elsewhere. It was served with mixed vegetables and a rice pilaf. The chicken asiago was served this rigatoni pasta in a cheesy Alfredo sauce and also with mixed vegetables. 

Portions were a very good size, and we were served sourdough bread with butter. 

Over all the food was good, the service could have been better.  Our observation was that there were a number of servers working, but they seemed to be somewhat disorganized and at times we felt like our waiter was rushing too much to take the time to really listen to what we were trying to order. They need to slow down a notch and be sure their guests are comfortable.

I had the breakfast burrito with egg whites and the vanilla bean panna cotta for dessert. Son, them flavors are on point. The spotlight goes to the ingredients. 

A pointer, though: the only component of my burrito which was not fresh was the tortilla, and it was painfully obvious. It really brought down the overall quality of the burrito which was excellent nonetheless thanks to the quality of everything else therein. If this place could make their tortillas by hand, it would become legendary. This is nitpicking, though; even most Mexican restaurants don't make their tortillas by hand, but any Latino well knows the magic of a fresh tortilla.

My friends and I ordered two appetizers and three entrees. The Asian boneless wings were delicious and flavorful. The garlic fries were aromatic and crispy, just the way I liked it.

But then it took forever for our entrees to come out even though the restaurant wasn't packed. I did really enjoy my rigatoni di pollo. The creamy tomato sauce was perfect and flavorful. The chicken was perfectly done.

The space is large, so wait times usually aren't too crazy, and the staff is all very friendly and speedy.

My wife and I got the early bird dinners since I talked her into sharing our meals.  I got the turf(NY Strip) and she hit the surf(Salmon)
The Salmon was good, moist and hot.  My steak was tough and so-so.  I forgot to tell our server that I wanted the pilaf over mash potatoes and he offer me a choice.  The vegetables were bland and cold as well as the mash potatoes.

86,Ei L.,"Walked in with a friend and was seated within walking in through the door.  That in itself was amazing.  Sadly, that was the ONLY highlight of the experience.  

We were seated at a table in the center of the front of the house. I should add the restaurant was not very busy...I didn't notice how many tables in the back were filled, but the bar area was empty (it was about 9:15 AM when we were seated), and maybe about half the tables in the front of the house were occupied.

I took at most 5 minutes to decide what to order and we both closed our menus, which, as I remember from working as a server in the past, is a sign to our server that we're ready to order.  Keep in mind, as we sat, no one after the hostess who seated us, approached us to even acknowledge that we were there.  Again, we are sitting in the middle of the restaurant, the 2 tables behind my friend are empty and the table to the left of me is empty.

My friend and I don't mind this, as we chat for a good 5-10 minutes, but during this time, we're trying to actually get eye contact with any of the servers or even a busperson to possibly get some water.  I looked over to the side where the kitchen area was, and everyone there was occupied with cooking, side work, and whatever else was needed to be done over there.  During this time though, I see 2 different servers that are tending to the tables around us.  One is taking food to their section, the other is taking water to the opposite section.  We're getting a bit frustrated because we don't know whose section we're a part of, but we figure, maybe it's considered busy for a Friday morning?

A table of 4 gets seated in the empty table to my right.  I jokingly look at my friend and tell him, ""If they get spoken to first, we're out of here.""

Literally within 2 minutes of them sitting, a server approaches them, smiling and seemingly happy, greets them, and asks them what they would like to have to drink.

Only when we stood up to leave did the server actually notice we were there.  We would have liked to have spoken to the manager, but we were unable to spot who that person was.",1.0,2018-07-28,0.341,0.204,0.454,406

The staff is always warm and welcoming and the food delicious.  The portions are large so my husband and I decided to split some dishes and still took home a lot of the leftover food.  Order the macaroni and cheese !  It is delicious.

91,Marisa D.,"Even though an employee hit me with a chair today, Jack's is getting two stars because the food is decent.   

I've eaten here a ton, but the breakfast service is getting to be unbearable bad.

When I placed my order, at the very beginning, I asked for a few items extra.  Hot sauce, butter, water- nothing unreasonable.

I had to ask multiple people multiple times for the items which never came.  Major disappointment.

At no time did anyone offer to refill my coffee cup.  Shoddy service, if even this simple diner-staple can't be accommodated.  

And THE BEST- an employee attempting to move a chair to another table HIT ME IN THE BACK WITH THE CHAIR.   

Really????

I mean, ask me to move if that's what you gotta do. But don't go around hitting people with flippin' chairs.  Airhead.  I am not paying you to hit me with a damn chair.

 Also, never order the Oatmeal- it is served refrigerator-cold.  Major YUCK.

The parking lot has not been paved in 10years...it is a huge mess full of deep holes. Dangerous.

96,Hugh L.,"We came here with the family and had high hopes to make this a regular spot. 
All in all we were very disappointed.
Had 3 burgers and the mediterranean plate. The meat of the burgers wasn't high quality, you could taste bits of cartilage. The buns were super soggy, so that the whole burger kept falling apart when eating. The extras were great, fresh onion tomato and iceberg lettuce (I prefer romaine).
Our kids were looking for sliders, but they don't offer them. On the mediterranean plate, the hummus was not real hummus. No Tahini, just ground chick peas, some odd spices, the rest of the mediterranean plate was tasty and fresh. The fries that came with the burgers were not super crunchy (like in n out) not my favorite, I prefer crispy. The worst was the red wine. I'm not very picky when it come to redwine, but this one tasted like gasoline (it was the California cab by the glass). I didn't drink it, wasn't offered a refund and didn't ask for one. 
Service was friendly while a bit slow. Food took a long time to arrive, even though they were not busy.
My advice: get better beef, toast your buns, and serve drinkable wine, and I may come back.

Bread is served, yay sourdough with butter. nothing special but hey it's free. The menu is a combination of burgers, pastas, mac and cheese, bar food like calamari, so like a BJ's Red Robin and CPK all in one. There are soups available too!

GF opt for some soup that was just ok also. We decided to split the Rigatoni something and I switched it out for spaghetti. When the good had come out, it wasn't really worth taking a photo of but of all the ingredients you could definitely make this at home if you wanted to.

When I got there 20 minutes later the person at the desk read me my order and it only had the two burgers. I told him about the salmon and he said he would add it in. I had to wait at least thirty minutes to get the salmon and by that time the rest of the food was cold. And on top of that they overcharged me by accidentally add in extra sides!

115,Donald W.,"I recently returned to Jack's restaurant and bar, after a number of years since my first visit. I must say I enjoyed myself and I enjoyed the meal I had here. I'm not sure why it took me so long to come back but I'm glad I did.

My friend and I arrived here on a Saturday afternoon and we decided we wanted to enjoy a quick lunch. When we stepped inside Jack's it was a lot bigger than I remembered. Maybe they went through a remodel, I'm not sure but it felt like more of an upscale kind of bar/ bistro. But the one thing I liked about this location was the fact that they catered more towards the comfort food I enjoy. For it being a Saturday afternoon we were seated immediately and although it was somewhat busy our waitress was on point and make sure that we did not have any lag time between us sitting and ordering our meals.

I noticed a fully stocked bar with TVs fully furnished around the restaurant allowing for multiple parties to enjoy different element of this location. As my friends and I ordered a bottle of wine, (and yes! there's nothing wrong with drinking wine in the middle of the afternoon as long as you don't have to go to work, LOL.) I couldn't help but notice that the staff really had everything under control and running smoothly. In fact it seemed as if everyone around us was enjoying themselves. That's always a plus because you never want to go into a restaurant and see people frustrated or waiting long periods of time for any reason. Now to our orders. I ordered a California burger, medium-well, covered with avocados, sautéed mushrooms and onions with a side of fries. My friends ordered the rigatoni pasta and another one ordered the Po-boy sandwich.

My burger was delicious and cooked perfectly. The sautéed onions and the creaminess of the avocado really complemented the patty perfectly. I'm a sucker for fries so there's almost no way that you can ruin that for me. I loved the fact that the fries were lightly salted and they made sure they were cooked to a crispy golden perfection. My friend, who ordered the pasta, seemed pleased with it. The only thing he tweaked was the fact that he felt it was missing something. So he ordered a side of Alfredo sauce so he could add some creaminess to the pasta. Once that was to his liking, he clearly was happy. 

The third friend who ordered the Po-boy devoured her sandwich within minutes, at least that what it felt like, lol. Although she's never been to New Orleans and had an authentic sandwich, she said that she really enjoyed the one at Jack's and would definitely order it again.

We all left Jack's happy and full. The prices were reasonable for the area and although we wish we could've stayed to order dessert, we were too full to eat anymore. But now have a reason to go back and that's perfectly OK with me. Thank you Jack's and the staff for making our Saturday afternoon a pleasant one.",3.0,2017-07-02,0.879,0.109,0.012,530
116,Ralph H.,"This place is better suited for those that are looking to have breakfast quickly and with similar options as other places. Came here this past weekend with 12 other people and they were able to accommodate us which is why we picked it. We were sat down quickly, the hostess was very helpful, our waitress was on top of everything. The food was average, some of us ( I had a great steak and eggs) had great food and some not so good. 

Again this place reminds me of Denny's type locations, which is not a bad thing but as the rating states, it was A-ok. I would come back to this place if i had a large group again and needed a last minute location.

As our drinks and the calamari came, the calamari was one of the best I've had, the batter well seasoned and the tenderness of the calamari was excellent. You know if the calamari was tough it we be over cooked, but it was cooked to perfection. Then we started receiving the entrees, the California Mac was first, because we mentioned we would like to share the California Mac, Kat our server had already brought the extra plates, at some restaurants you would have to mention it a second time to the wait staff.

I got Mary's half chicken sub with mashed potatoes instead of roasted potatoes. It was very sour.. I know there's supposed to be lemon and thyme as seasoning, but the lemon was over powering! The plate also looked a bit unappetizing. I'm guessing they added some of the lemon-thyme broth onto the bottom of the plate, which made all of my mashed potatoes and vegetables have that sour taste. The vegetables also tasted like they were frozen and they just microwaved it. It was bit disappointing.

My boyfriend got the spaghetti carbonara which was wayyy more tasty than my sad dish. After stealing a 3rd or 4th bite, I had a weird after taste in my mouth. It was equivalent to biting into a block of stale cheese. Idk.. It just tasted like old cheese after a while..

I gave it a try, and surprisingly they almost gave homeroom a run for their money! Big portions, lots of taste and delicious add ins. Of course, their Mac and cheese options are not as extensive as homerooms, but they do serve a mean Mac and cheese dish.

Kit had the turkey club sandwich, huge and fulfilling. Tons of meat but it was a little dry. I noticed they didn't put any condiments on the sandwich, but the tomato and lettuce gave it a little moisture. 

The leftovers are great for later that day or even tomorrow morning. We didn't make it in time for breakfast (served until 2pm) but we saw the out coming breakfast plates and they looked gooooood.

A: food that looked better than it tasted
B: food that tasted better than it looked 

Which would you choose?

If I only ordered the items I enjoyed the most, this would have been a 5 star review. However, as is the case with Yelp, the entire meal you eat and pay for is reviewed. 

The Thai Steak Salad was perfection on a plate. The house made salad dressing, crisp, icy cold vegetables, lovely rice noodles, and delicious strips of steak that were actually cooked MEDIUM pretty much deserves 5 stars and raves all day. 

The Zucchini cake appetizer was also delicious. 

The rest of the food I ordered - BAD. Clearly my photos illustrate how delicious everything looked. Looks are deceiving. Yes, they are. The pot roast entrees I ordered for my daughters tasted old and the sauce was sugary. It was really awful to pay for 2 entrees that neither person wanted so they ate my food and I was stuck with ...well, their food that I couldn't eat. I ordered a fried chicken entree as well. It was bland. It was really bland. The spanikopita was greasy as hell.

134,Rochelle M.,"I came here for a family dinner. The restaurant is situated fairly close to the 380/280 HWY and across from Tanforan Mall in San Bruno. The parking area is small, but parking when we came at 7:00 pm on a weekday was easy. I can imagine finding parking to be bad on a busy Friday night or weekend. 

The hostess were nice and greets you with a smile. The servers were very friendly and attentive and made sure you never ran out of anything to drink. 

We ordered calamari to start and it wasn't anything amazing. It tasted like calamari and there was nothing that set it apart from others. They offered bread, I believe it was sourdough? But like the calamari, it wasn't special. 

We were a fairly large party of 10 and ordered different things. When we ordered our food came out promptly. But, here is where the minus one star. They runners that's were bringing out our food seemed new and unaware of what the dishes were. It appeared that our main server was still training and educating them, since they had mixed the pot roast and meatloaf and seemed like they couldn't figure out which is what. This left us confused. But, our server was quick in his feet and was able to correct the mistake. 

Only one person out of 10 had finished their dish and the rest of us had it to go. I ordered the rigatoni. It was good but got a little salty because of the bacon.'

We did end up ordering deserts. I ordered the cappuccino pana cotto. It was good, and the caffeine hit me later (that's why I'm still up at 12:00 am writing a review) 

Overall this place was good and I can see myself coming here again. The the service was nice and prompt, the prices are fair for the portions. I would recommend you come stop by and give this place a try at least once.",4.0,2017-11-28,0.351,0.445,0.205,330

142,Edward L.,"Reminds of the chain restaurants on the lines of: TGIFs, Applebee's, OG.

Not that there's anything wrong with them. Love me some good chain restaurant food. But, when you live in the bigger cities, and in the Bay Area, hard to go to these because of diversity of authentic choices around. 

Went here with the fam. Good spot because of they have quite a variety on the menu, such as burgers/pastas/pot roast/meatloaf/seafood. Something for everyone hopefully.

Decor is unimaginative, but what else do you expect for a place like this.

Foodwise: pork chop, shrimp scampi, calamari appetizer, pot roast, mac&cheese.

I'm going to comment on my dish: the Porkchop. Saw some Yelp pics with some nice searing action. Had to try it. And I was disappointed. It's double cut, and so it's thick. You would think that would mean juicy, but Jack's overdid this one a bit too long. It's dry. When you pay for one of the more expensive dishes on the menu, that sucks dude. 

Calamari has that crispsy outside, and not overbattered. The aioli is great dipping.

My fam kinda enjoyed their dishes, but weren't blown out of the water. Jack's is a good spot if you have an eclectic group who can't decide on a genre of food. Otherwise, I have another reason to go choosing more legit places.",2.0,2015-09-10,0.68,0.234,0.085,223

The server was attentive, answered my questions and gave me tips on what's good to eat ( much appreciated). The food is always delicious so there was no issue with what I ordered. We got the lamb meatballs and a bay shrimp quesadilla (it was happy hour) and for my drink I got the Spiked sweet tea.

That shows he's trying hard and that's what I liked about my visit.

158,Jenn X.,"Jack's is great. It's a family restaurant, a sports bar, and kind of a Chili's, all in one. It has a subtle Mediterranean influence that we really love.

We enjoy bringing friends to Jack's to share the avgolemono soup with them! (Inspired, my husband taught himself how to make avgolemono in the electric pressure cooker.) I'm gluten-intolerant, but I still have the palate of a child, so I especially love the meatloaf, pot roast, and gluten-free bacon mac. The burgers are great and the zucchini cakes (with tzatziki sauce) are terrific! But perhaps Jack's greatest strength is breakfast and brunch. The crowd is lively and the menu truly has something for everyone. I wish it were brunch always at Jack's, because I love omelettes and fruit medleys.

My husband and I have been visiting Jack's for two and a half years now, maybe once every couple weeks, and we highly recommend it. Except for the time I stormed out on a holiday, we've never had an unpleasant experience, and we quite like everyone who works there! Our longtime fave is a young man our age, Stuart, who is especially efficient and thoughtful. But everyone there is great.

In the end, I highly recommend Jack's, especially if you have friends visiting you here in San Bruno. The vibe is great, the folks are friendly, and the food is damned good. Enjoy!!",5.0,2017-07-26,0.569,0.321,0.11,230

EXPERIENCE:
For all intents and purposes, a diner is a diner is a diner, until you are seated at the bar at Jack's, and then it's indeed a bar, not a diner, and that's perfect.   

LUNCH:

- Coconut Shrimp w/coleslaw 
- Classic Burger  - LTOP / Brioche Bun, Swiss Cheese
- Fries - String
- Cock & Bull Ginger Beer / Seltzer
- NY Cheesecake w/Strawberries and Blueberries 

Coconut shrimp were fried to crispy perfection and gone in 60 seconds.  The slaw/salad was good too, lasted a little longer. My ginger beer was just the right combo.

""Bar Burger"" - I'm going to let the pictures do the talking but here is what you need to know...this burger had a humongous patty that was char-grilled presenting a deliciously striking texture, swiss cheese slipping over its edge, mmmmmm, it all smelled so amazing! (and that is not the sense usually put into play at a din_ , I mean bar!)  Even the lettuce, tomato and onion were uncommonly cold, does the waiter pick those out of the fridge on the way out ?

I took one bite and juices poured out on to my plate...I was immediately reminded of Gene Hackman's character in the French Connection begging his captors for a burger from PJ Clarke's with the ""juices pouring out."" Jack's Burger would do just fine.... extremely flavorful...Brioche bun....mmm mmm good!  The fries were good too.

How about some cheesecake? I justified it by saying to myself this burger demands it (not good enough) ...ok,  how else will Yelper's know? (Good enough, ding!)  Cheesecake please! and out it came in all its glory...strawberry drizzle, fresh blueberries and strawberries....it was really good (not on the level of the burger mind you, but good) and I was way off the reservation, Dr. Miranda Bailey would not be pleased.

SERVICE:
I prefer dining at the bar whenever possible.  Service is one of those reasons, the dynamic of it is the second.  Can't say enough about the service here, the ambiance probably amps up during happy hours and later hours but was fine for lunch...maybe the din from the dining area subtracting just a little...

SUMMARY:

Repeat customers enjoy Jack's for its consistent quality food and service, and where the bar makes the perfect burger (hold the mayo).",4.0,2016-10-14,0.445,0.368,0.187,392
160,Ron Q.,"I was on the way back to SFO from an all day meeting when I got the dreaded text from the airline saying my flight had been delayed almost an hour.  Now what do I do with my time....  Oh, grab a bite to eat!  Stopped in at Jack's with a colleague.  It wasn't too fancy shmancy nor overly casual in appearance.  Probably a nicer ambiance than many.  Not quite a sports bar, even though there were a couple large screen TVs behind the bar.

We ordered a couple of cocktails prior to dinner.  My friend's drink wasn't quite right, so she sent it back and ordered a glass of wine. No problems there.  When our dinners came out, I had ordered the chicken piccata served with grill veggies and rice pilaf.  Not sure why, but when my plate arrived, it had no rice.  It now came with quinoa.  The server said it was because they ran out of rice.  Hmmm, not sure if that's happened before.  May also have been that they ordered the wrong side!?!?  Anyway, I was happy with the quinoa, but would have rathered the rice.  Also would've been nice if someone would have mentioned something in advance of my plate and food arriving.

Anyway, the food was good.  The ambiance was welcoming and the sides had some good flavor.  Not a bad option if you're headed to SFO and have time to kill prior to flight time!  Our server did come over and check in on us frequently, but we were satisfied with the selection and choices.

171,Michele M.,This was my first time coming here and I really don't think I will be back.  I came on a Saturday night so I assume they are busier than they would be on other nights.  The parking lot is pretty small but we did manage to find parking.  We were greeted promptly and the wait was about 15 minutes which was fine.  My thought was that this place was supposed to be a slightly more upscale place than BJs.  My first thought upon entering the dining room is this place is really just a diner that was trying to look a little fancy a long time ago but is now just worn out.  I'm not trying to be a snob by saying that.  I love diners and dives but this place really does feel like worn out and not in a favorite pair of jammies kind of way.  And it is loud.  Uncomfortably so.  The server was attentive and quick.  The bread was delicious.  What really bothered me most about this place was when the bill came there was an extra appetizer on there that we did not order.  Now I've never worked at a restaurant so I can't say how easy it may be to make this mistake but I also cannot recall any other time this has happened to me.  When we brought it to the waiter's attention he mumbled a sorry and said he would fix it.  His lack of sincere apology makes me think he did it on purpose.

Our party ordered a variety of dishes which included a salmon salad, lamb chops, potroast, sunset burger, steak, and a bacon mac and cheese for me. The potroast was good and the bacon in the mac and cheese seemed over cooked but I'm not sure if it's supposed to be like that. I was only able to eat half of it considering that I ate some calamari and a few pieces of bread. Regardless, it still tasted good.

Took a large party of our family and guests a few nights ago.

The kitchen had a bad night. 

I'm sure the badly cooked food was correctable before it left the kitchen, but nobody caught it any of the issues. We ate them. Not all of the dishes were badly prepared.

I don't like sending dishes back, really.  And I should have. But we will from now on.

182,Bonnie J.,"It was my first visit to this restaurant although have passed it by for years, but friends suggested that we have dinner there.  Great! 

We made reservations and arrived on time and once seated the table, all was good.  I asked the waiter if there was a kids menu since I brought my two daughters along and was directed on the second page of the corner.  So, my girls decided they wanted a plain hamburger and my other daughter wanted a plain cheeseburger, while I ordered the Petrale Sole.  

Everything was looking up and we got our food.  My fish was so bland no matter how much salt I tried to put on it so that was a big disappointment.  I tried to eat as much as I can and  my girls got their burgers with fries. One ate the burger, didn't touch the fries, the other ate about 3/4 of the burger and didn't touch the fries.

Once we finished our meal and received our check, I looked and saw that  my girls were charged for a regular adult burgers rather than Children's price so I flagged down the waiter and he explained that we didn't specify so they got regular burgers.  I didn't realize that I had to specify it considering that was the first thing I asked when we sat down was the children's menu and what about clarifying it when taking the order if it would be from the Children's menu or regular? The blame can go both ways.

In any event, he was gracious about it and said he would speak to his manager to take it off. Well, this lady who I assume is the Manager comes back and say,""Well, they were given regular burgers and they ate it.""  Are you kidding? What kind of customer service is that??? When I dine out, I expect courtesy and excellent service which is DEFINITELY not what I got from this Manager.  My friend waved it off, but it's just about principle and professionalism. I come from the food industry and it is just basic business 101 that mistakes happen and you do what you can to rectify the issue to appease your customers so that they would come back.

I told him again that I ordered angel hair pasta with chicken. He apologized and took my whole plate of pasta away to get chicken added. Another 10 mins go by, and he dropped off my plate and left in a hurry. I was just about to dig in and realized I had no utensils.

188,Laurie L.,"Here is the break down.

1. For a place to appear to have equal employee to patron ratio why is service not on point? Poor management....No one is paying attention, it's a social scene for the majority of the workforce here. The food runners seem to bust their asses and a couple of waitresses carry the weight. Everyone else including what appeared to be the manager just aimlessly wander and socialize with the slacker groups... Pathetic to witness...Our server was good but over burdened due to poor management and slacker coworkers, she was cranky and quite frankly how could she not be?
2. The food was not anything worth coming back for...But it could be if they made some changes.
3. My Cobb salad sucked to the point I hated it. The chicken was precooked cold, tasteless, and dry. Cook it to order and add some flavor...The pre-mixed dressing instead of serving on the side is lame it wilted everything and even then I had to order side dressing to rehydrate the chicken.
3. The burgers were not cooked as ordered, if a Chili's can make a better burger you need to rethink your culinary approach.
4. Prices...Don't over price mediocre food it's insulting to the customer.",3.0,2017-03-26,0.004,0.019,0.978,207

I've been here before so I already knew what to expect food wise, and given that, you might be wondering why the one-star. Well, I ordered the spaghetti and clams and on the menu, the item says that red sauce is optional and by default it is served with white sauce. Not being too fond of red sauce, I told our waiter, Maria, I wanted white sauce just to be sure it isn't served with red sauce. Sure enough, a different waiter comes and gives me spaghetti with RED sauce. I respectfully told him I ordered it with white sauce and he takes it back, and moments later, Maria comes back with the same plate telling me that that is what I ordered. I said, ""no, I said I wanted white sauce."" She pretty much insisted I was wrong by saying ""no, I wrote down red sauce, that's what you said, I swear.""

As for the drinks, I can only speak about the Moscow Mule made with Russian Standard vodka. It tasted sweet and not very strong initially but my body felt it later. Maybe the good stuff does sneak up on you. It was about $10 before tax and tip.

I would have thought my one order of a Sunset Boulevard burger well done without pickles and onions was easy, until I cut into it back at the office.  I always order my meat well done (sorry, not pick at all for me) and ended up seeing pink inside.  It looked like I might be able to eat most of it as the meat looked like it might only be a little pink, but as I cut into it, I realized it was not even close to being well done or medium well.

anyways, ordered the calamari as an appetizer, and for entrees we got the pot roast and shrimp scampi pasta. food was delicious, i can't complain at all. the calamari portions weren't skimpy, although we did pay extra for fried jalapenos to be added and they only gave us like 4 or 5 pieces. pot roast was delicious, and the shrimp scampi was scrumptious.

203,Stan L.,"Jack's is probably my favorite breakfast spot in the area. I probably passed by a hundred times on my way to Tanforan but was always hesitant to try until one of my close foodie friend said I must try. 

The service was slow. From the moment I walked in to waiting for the server to write my order. They were nice and friendly. But unless you have the morning free and not in a rush to work, I wouldn't recommend here. 

The food is completely opposite to the service. I ordered the MIGHTY MOOSE and on first sight, the portion was MIGHTY indeed!  There were four pieces of English muffin loaded with crispy hash browns (requested extra crispy), crispy and not soggy bacon, country fried steak with gravy and poached eggs to top. Taste was fantastic. I was surprised how well the eggs were poached as the yolk ran all over the steak and gravy. Yummy! Not too many restaurants poach eggs well and this is not one of those. The bacon was very crisp but not overly crunchy. The hash browns were crisped as I requested. Gravy and steak were ok. Not dry but didn't wow me to it's surrounding compliments. 

With so much food, most of which were fried, I was pretty dehydrated at the end. Yet, nobody filled my water or asked if I needed anything else. It was slow to get my bill and my change back. If their service improves, this would be my go to place for breakfast. Shame because the food was excellent.

When you do get seated the service is pretty decent and the selection is variable and plenty.
From breakfast to dinner most of the dishes seem a little expensive, but the portions are huge!  I'd definitely recommend coming here w/a empty stomach unless you're coming here for the yogurt and appetizers.  Best choice for breakfast would be the omelettes since it comes w/a generous helping of hashbrowns done right where it's not too soft but just enough top crisp to it. 

For lunch and dinner there's just too much to name, but the burgers, mac and cheese, sandwiches, and pasta are my go to's when breakfast isn't offered anymore after 2pm.

2 TVs are at the bar and 1 in the back room and it usually gets loud and crowded during big local sport games.

211,Tabitha E.,"This is an A-OK place, nothing wow-ing, but nothing bad really either, its more of a 3.5 star place, but I am generous. I've been twice while in the area, mostly due to convenience (location, location, location). And to note, both times were dinner visits, so I can't comment on breakfast skills. It is clean, can get loud, and is pretty busy a lot of the time. They have great early bird dining specials too. 

The bread is really good, nice and sour. We split the mussels appetizer the first visit, and it was really tasty, fresh and tender mussels in a tangy, tomato sauce. I ordered the shrimp linguine which I thought would be more creamy. The shrimp were plentiful and cooked right, and it was a great sized portion. The sauce ended up just being a bit too tangy and zingy for my taste. But that isn't really their fault. My fiancé got their fish and chips and he was pretty disappointed as the fish had absolutely no flavor/seasoning, including the breading. The ""chips"" were good though. 

The second visit, my friend got some appetizer, the homemade spanakopita which spinach, feta cheese, dill, leeks in phyllo pastry. I didn't try it but he ate it all and liked it. While I got the fried chicken early bird dinner with ""gravy""... I put gravy in quotes because I got the weirdest looking gravy ever! It was still good, but more of a broth with chunks of tomatoes... regardless I could have used more but I don't know if it would be definied as a gravy haha. The chicken itself was moist and juicy, the skin could have had a little more seasoning, but really was not bad for the price. 

All in all, I would go back, but not because I am craving anything particular, they have a good happy hour menu too (that I didn't get to take advantage of). Also the back of the menu I thought was pretty cute and creatively funny.

222,Raul R.,"I would have loved to have given this place more stars in my review because the food was very good, well portioned and reasonably priced. However, I can not over look the fact that this place fell short on a very key issue. 
I made a reservation for a party of five that was included my two daughters. My entire party got to the restaurante 15 minutes before our reservation time, per request of the restaurante on the website. The wait time was non existent as they already had our table ready. As the hostess sat us down, we noticed several servers and waitstaff in our area helping other parties. After about 15 to not quite 20 minutes waiting, with very hungry daughters, we flagged a busboy and asked for some water and maybe bread. A few more minutes went by, as well as servers, and still no one came to take drink orders even though we were ready to order food by that point. I finally stood up and approached the hostess desk and a server finally followed me and took our order. 
To the credit of the server, who's name was Jonathan, he was the one person who saved our visit, the manager did comp our appetizer as well. The membership my party all agreed that if it wasn't for Johnathan, this dinner would not have sat well and for that we are all grateful and because of him I will be back, hopefully with better results on waiting.",3.0,2017-10-21,0.355,0.417,0.228,251

*Efficient- Cocktail and food service efficient as far as how long it takes from when you give and receive your order.
*CONSISTENT- I feel consistency is what separates a ""Ok"" establishment from a ""Great"" one. I've been going here since it opened. I can honestly say that each time I've been to Jacks.

The mashed potatoes were buttery and garlicky. The chicken wasn't the most moist, but it wasn't dry either. My friend had the California Mac & Cheese. She said it was a bit watery. I recommend going to Homeroom in Oakland if you want amazing mac and cheese.

Overall, this place is decent and reasonably priced with good portions. Service was friendly and quick. It reminds me of chain restaurants like TGIFs and Applebee's, so don't expect to be blown away, but it was good.

It took 10 minutes to get a table but no biggie as we hung in the bar area and got to enjoy a little happy hour. We had the Wedge off the HH menu and it was great as was the chips and guacamole. The service was outstanding across the board, from the hostess to servers, runners and bussers, even the manager picked up the check and ran it for our girl as she was swamped!

We also enjoyed the Fried Chicken dinner, which came with potatoes, veggies and a soup to start. Wow what a meal! and a STEAL at $16

They sat us in a circular booth in the backroom.  Our server was very nice and fast.  We didn't have to sit and wait for things.  I ordered the grilled chicken with mashed potatoes.  That was very yummy and the chicken was not dried out.  DH had the gyro which he said was pretty good.  Kids had hot dog and chicken fingers.  Not much to write home about in terms of the kids' meals.  Kid meals do not include drinks so everyone had water.

Not bad but I'm not sure if I want to endure the long waits here.  Also parking is such a bitch!  you would think being near an office complex and condos that there is plenty of parking.  Not so.  Poor planning on the building owners' part.",4.0,2015-07-27,0.04,0.201,0.759,175

230,Vanessa G.,"I went on Thursday afternoon for a meal at Jack's and fortunately still found they were serving breakfast as I made it 15 minutes before the cut off time! I was seated immediately in the dining area near the bar.  The tables were cleaned and ready to go and almost immediately the waitress stopped by to say hello and asked if I had any questions about their menu.  I usually order a salad for lunch time, but since I was still on time for the breakfast menu, I took a glance at their omelettes.  They have a large variety of omelettes to choose from ranging from meat filled options to pure veggies and cheese. 
I went for the Monterey Omlette (without swiss cheese, please), wheat toast, and replaced the hash browns for a bowl of fresh fruit.  The omelette was made with egg whites and filled with spinach and chicken, and lastly topped with a pico de gallo like salsa and sliced avocado. Great size and totally yummy! 
My only complaint would be that the toast came heavily pre-buttered...next time, i'll order it dry.

236,Mike C.,"When a friend invited me to dinner in San Mateo, my stomach and palate was prepared to enjoy some down home, homecooking comfort food.  My host's father is a famous Chinatown comfort food restaurant chef in the '60's and '70's.  After we learned that our original dinner place was closed for a month, my friend told me to follow him here.  As you exit the 92 freeway from SF, you'll literally see this place at your nose.  Parking can be challenging in the mall lot peak times, but my friend pointed out a space a baseball toss away.  The dining room was bustling, about 70% full.  As the basketball games played on the bar TV's, the atmosphere was hustlin' and bustlin'.  After studying the menu, my friend recommended several dishes so I tried the following:

Shared
Tutto mare (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=upvmXMSi9XkBAubmNG87Jw) - Nice presentation and a good variety of seafood (clams, mussels, shrimp).  Sauce is on the lighter side, making this a cleaner tasting dish.

Meat loaf (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=uc8fF3jTls-6j-UkOKtz4w) - Hearty and campfire type meal.  Smooth Yukon mash topped with a balanced (not dry and still firm) texture covered with a rich mushroom gravy topped with a large crispy fried onion.  Mouthful to describe and eat!

For an additional $2.50, I added a house salad with lettuce, cucumber slices, and tomato pieces.  I ate about a third of the pasta, my salad, and half of my meat loaf... call it a 3-course tasting menu.  My friend had the pot roast (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=pv2C4dneTnFfjAIVToR13A) which is consistent with my dish as traditional comfort food.  He also touted their hamburger steak, but stomach space did not allow us to try that this evening.  The prices are reasonable, $12.00 to $20.00 for dinner entrees at decent portions.  Probably not a date night type meal, more of a chow down one

Great atmosphere with high ceilings and a large bar. The tables have ample space between each and accommodate groups and couples. The front waiting area is tight though.

Service:
Our waiter was so friendly and apologetic for the wait (even though it wasn't that bad). 

Eats:
-Lamb burger: so juicy and not gamey as lamb can be sometimes. 
-Chili mac: this was so good and was a very large portion. I was so happy to have leftovers! Not the healthiest option, but loved that it was heavy on the cheese. Would be a great option to share with the table if you don't want it as an entrée.",5.0,2016-10-11,0.453,0.419,0.129,109
239,Sunny S.,"Jack's?  More like Crack's (ugh, sorry for that offensive mom joke).

This place deserves 5 stars just for that Jack's ice tea that is guaranteed to put a smile on your face for the rest of the day (or, in the alternative, could put you on your ass all day if you have more than 2).  

The best breakfast here are those Swedish pancakes with the lingonberry sauce.  Unfortunately, I can never have this because if I even look at it, I instantly gain 5 lbs.  I try to stay away from carbs, and I'm happy to say Jack's is pretty conducive to this lifestyle.  I always get the omelets, cobb salad, and caesar salad with chicken.  

If you don't give a shit about your weight (you lucky SOB), then you should try that delicious avgolemono soup, which rocks your ass off (and then pads it with fat as well).  The gyro is super good too, but they only serve it at lunch.  

Even though I have no children, I'd like to note that Jack's is extremely child-friendly.  They have kids cups, a good kids' menu, and have kid-friendly seating (i.e., booths, high chairs, and booster seats).  The waiters are nice to the kids, too.  

Drawback:  The parking situation here is a super suck-fest.  It got so bad they had to hire some security guard to make sure you are not parking in the dentists' office next door, which must be a front for some illegal drug trafficking ring.  No one ever goes there.  I think they built a new parking lot next door to Jack's (on the opposite side), but it's not clear,  Something definitely needs to be done about that situation though--it is frakking terrible.

My sister just had her undergrad recognition ceremony from SFSU so we purposely went out of our way to eat in the peninsula to avoid crowds and lack of parking, etc. in the city. No such luck on either here! Parking in the (small) lot was cramped & full. Our party of 6 arrived at noon and was told it was going to be a 45 minute wait. It was a cold day and we sucked it up waiting outside since the waiting area inside was packed.

When we were finally seated, everything was smooth sailing from that point on. Our server was ON POINT. I wish I remembered her name... she always came at the right times, water glasses and coffees were constantly refilled, and she never skipped a beat when we needed to order a side of this or an another drink or extra napkins. We all know it can get a bit complicated when it's a bigger group. 

As for the food, everything came out right and no one had any complaints. The Mediterranean appetizer platter and calamari w/ jalapeños are a must have. The chicken tortilla soup... well, I've had better but it wasn't bad.

248,Cat C.,"Came here for a party of 18 (Bf's family brunch get-together)..good news, we were able to make a reservation due to the big size of our party, bad news, it was a set menu.  The menu choices that seemed to be the most popular around the table were the Jack's Omelette & the Bananas Foster French Toast.  There were no prices listed on our menus.  I asked for the cinnamon cream on the side and the waitress said she could see if they could do it but normally they don't do substiutions for big parties.  What substitution?  I'm just asking for it on the side, since they'd put it on top otherwise!  

Anyways, the Bananas Foster French Toast was alright; definitely not in my top couple French Toast dishes but not bad at all.  Three pieces of toast topped with some caramelized banana slices with the cinnamon cream on the side.  It was not overly sweet at all, and only needed a teeny bit of syrup on one of the slices of bread.  However the bread just looked like standard white bread, nothing special.  The cinnamon cream was like a whipped cream cheese but very faint in flavor.  His plate with the Jack's Omelette was huge and came with avocado, bacon, cheddar, mushrooms and tomatoes.  It was served with a big serving of hash browns and toast.  We had to remind the wait staff twice however about his toast.  I had a few tastes of his breakfast and thought everything tasted so bland...even though there was glorious bacon & cheese in it!    

Come to find out though the set menu options had different items with different prices they up charged $13 per entree (the most expensive one is $10.95) plus I believe they tacked on a cake cutting charge as well as the gratuity.  So my $8.95 French Toast plus OJ turned into more like a $20 meal.   For three slices of regular white bread (not Acme bread or Tartine just normal store bought) dipped in egg & milk with a third of a banana with some cream cheese & a small glass of OJ?!!  *Shudders*   Been wanting to try Jack's, but a lot of the aspects of Sunday brunch here just turned me off.  I think if they actually let the menu prices of the items be applicable to a set menu then I wouldn't have been so bothered.",2.0,2012-12-11,0.684,0.217,0.099,400

254,Nina D.,"Declining Food & Drink Quality and Spotty Service is all that comes to mind, given the dozen times we've dined here over last couple years.

While their servers try their best, they often seem overwhelmed.  Their bartenders are often backed up on Friday nights and can't seem to poor a glass of wine within 20 minutes.  Also, not sure their bartenders completed bartending school, as they seem not to know what a decent vodka martini tastes like.

If you order a special entree after 9PM, they are often out.  This has happened the last 4 times we've dined there.  The server takes our order and says they still have the entree, only to be informed 10 minutes later, they're actually out.

Drive further north to Boulevard Cafe in Westlake to enjoy better prepared cocktails, similar though better quality food and more consistent service.  

I give the place 2 stars for staying open later on weekend nights and because their servers and bussers all seem like good people.   Bottom line:  Their management needs to step it up and run a more consistent dining operation before we return.  I'm guessing they've grown complacent because they have a decent regular crowd and don't have much competition in the area.",2.0,2016-07-30,0.305,0.353,0.342,206

The five of us popped into Jack's Thursday around 8:45am on our way down to San Mateo.  Menus given immediately to us and coffee filled ASAP.

264,Julia K.,"It was my first time trying this place out. I will give it a 4.5. We ordered breakfast for pickup. We got two of the Greek scrambles, one hangover, and one mighty moose. All of which were very fresh and good. We also got one order of the calamari and it wasn't bad also but it got soggy pretty quickly. By the time we ate it, there was no crispness left to it, but I'm almost positive it's because it was standing in a box so long. The flavor was great and all the breakfast specials were cooked perfectly. There was no wait after we ordered for pickup so that was awesome. 

Now that I've ordered from this place I am really curious to try their food for lunch and dinner. Seems like this could be very yummy! I will have to come back :)",4.0,2014-09-08,0.324,0.351,0.325,145

The usual sequence of events on Saturday/Sundays:

((Insert long, direction-free conversation on where we should brunch here))

..... a few minutes later, we decide on Jack's. Load up the car, drive over, and make a bee-line to the bar. Take a high-top (because there's always at least ONE ... or three available). Order water. Order coffee. Order decaf. Country fried steak for me, omelette for him. Eat. Indulge. Repeat in 7 days.

They do hash browns right - crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside. Their sausage gravy is yummy and hearty and goes well with EVERYTHING (we actually order a side of the gravy on occasions that I don't order country fried steak). Our eggs are perfect EVERY TIME. Service at the bar is quick and friendly. The hardest part is figuring out how to fit all of the plates on your table.

Portions are large. Prices are fair. Food is consistently yummy. It's exactly what you would want in a go-to place for brunch, lunch, brekkie, happy hour, and dinner.

I have a large group of girls that go out often for dinner and drinks but the fact that they don't have a good specialty  drink menu makes them want to go other places.  I guess Jacks just wants a family style restaurant instead of bringing in more clientele that will order multiple drinks and food.   San Bruno location will also not seat you until all your party has arrived which is annoying.  Don't they realize people will start ordering drinks and appetizers while they wait if some people get off work different hours or get stuck in traffic?

271,Brandon Y.,"Being pretty close to work, I've been to Jack's a couple times and have been able to experience lunch, happy hour, and dinner here. Everything was pretty much A-OK, as yelp likes to put it, and nothing really stood out too much.

Lunch - I typically go with the burger, which are above average - 1/2 lb and tender. California Burger is good with the avocado & mushrooms, and fries are above average as well

Happy Hour - HH deals are decent - $4 beers, $5 cocktails, $5 appetizers. Fun with a group - Go for the sweet potato fries as the wings are quite miniscule

Dinner - I've had the Mediterranean platter and mac here. Both were about average. I appreciate the effort to jazz up the mac w/ different additions like bacon, or mushrooms/spinach, or italian sausage and sundried tomatoes, however it wasn't mind-blowing.

I've never had a problem with the service, so I'd agree to the 3.5 star average for Jack's, although I also wish their beer selection was greater...",3.0,2013-04-18,0.489,0.268,0.242,173
272,David S.,"A for effort.

At the bar, I asked for a Lava Lamp, which apparently is this little known Piña Colada cocktail that my favorite Thai place -- Sophia's -- makes in Davis. It took four of us -- the two bartenders, my date and I -- to figure out how to make it. Note: the cell reception sucks in this place! We all came up with this ""Lava Flow"" concoction on allrecipes. One bartender went and found a banana in the kitchen and assembled all the parts. Pretty good! Not perfect, but it was her first try. And she was really sweet about it.

The wait took FOREVER, but the servers provided my date and I with a huge booth for just the two of us. Service was prompt. Food was good. I had a shrimp louie, which was surprisingly lacking in heavy dressing ... in a good way.

Miscellaneous:

- Lots on the menu at a reasonable price.
- Pretty dark and casual atmosphere. Nothing to write home about, but better than a manufactured experience at BJ's across the street.
- Guys, seriously, WHAT is with all the birthdays here? I am up for a casual celebration, but you can go somewhere else. (No offense, Jack's). Come here for delish food and to gossip with your BFFs over cosmos.",5.0,2014-08-19,0.182,0.32,0.498,220

277,Lia K.,"I'm highly disappointed on how downhill this place has become.   I work down the street from Jacks , so my coworkers and I order here multiple times a week.   We spend on average  $200 a week on food, mostly salad, here.    
It is VERY inconsistent.    Every other time my Jacks salad is half the size that it normally is.   I pay extra for avocado,  and a lot of the time it is brown,  or there is only 2 little slivers.   Sometimes they forget to put the cheese or walnuts in my salad too.   And I always ask for bread and butter, but they have NEVER put butter in my bag.  (I always need to ask for butter when I get there)

Well today set me over the top.     I called in to order 2 jacks salads with chicken.   Lucio took my order.   After I ordered I tried to explain to Lucio that our salads are very inconsistent and he told me that it's impossible because every single salad is measured, so everything is ALWAYS the same.    I proceeded to tell him that I order here multiple times a week and it is definitely never the same.   He said ""well when you come in you can look at them.""

So now I'm already upset because he's basically telling me I'm wrong, and I'm a liar. 
I get to the restaurant within 15 minutes and my order is ready.   He sees me walk in and he immediately went to get his superior, Magnolia.    I heard him say ""I already know this is her""  and Magnolia said to him ""yeah I can tell"". 
All Magnolia asked me was for my name.   She swiped my card and Lucio attempted to be nice by asking me how I was doing.  
I asked Magnolia for butter and she got it for me.  I had my hand extended, so that she can just hand it to me.    Magnolia decided to toss the butter in the bag that was out of her reach, instead of just handing it to me.   

Yeah I'm totally done with Jacks now.   I didn't even bother to say anything while I was there because I've personally talked with Magnolia AT LEAST 3 times before,  and nothing has ever been done.  

It sucks that the food is really good,  but the really poor customer service and very inconsistent proportions will drive me, along with my coworkers,  far away from this place.

I got the Petite NY Steak was not that small. It was 9 oz grilled steak, and I'll say very decent size steak and it was so good. $17.95 
I was with my gf, she got the Fried Chicken. $15.95 It was Very juicy!
Both orders were including soup and coffee.
The soup was beef barley, I really liked it.

It is not a high-end restaurant, it's kind of like a Lawrence Welk sports bar so you may run into a low-life idiot often, but most people are family members trying to have a decent weekend dinner together. It's a family affair, so we all have, at least one idiot in the family.

My girlfriend raved about it. My sister raved too because she read about the burgers but she looked up a restaurant with a similar name. 
The descriptions were really yummy but what came was disappointing. $15 burger with bacon. avocado, on sourdough. It was 2 small thin sliced of sourdough bread, patty shrunk down due to cooking.... ok... but not $15. The small scoop of potato salad was very good. My sister had burger with brioche bun.. $12 or $13 with side of salad. The side was a few leaves, not even a cherry tomato. She added it to her burger. I had 2X2X2. 2 eggs,, cooked perfrctly, 2 delicious sausages and 2 slices of thin french toast that probably would have been better if they left it as plain toast.

I settled on the chili Mac and cheese which was pretty tasty. The chili flavor was really hearty and didn't overpower the Mac like I had anticipated. Good balance! I wish it was cheesier though. Underneath that top cheese layer was basically noodles and chili. We also split the bananas foster French toast and that was freaking decadent! Loving that maple whipped cream.

that I will never be back. Kitchen brought out 5 out of 7 of the orders with a 5 minute or more lag time for the other two orders to arrive. We with the late arriving orders were just starting our meal as the rest of the group was finishing theirs. One booth over there was a large party of people who were having a speaker phone chat with a group of people
who knows where. They had the speaker phone on so loud and were talking so loud our group could not hold a conversation. Never in all my many years of eating all over the world have I ever encountered such
blatant rudeness. I spoke to three different waitstaff who did nothing
and finally asked for a manager, who was able to come to our table and
see for herself how invasive the situation was. Her response was, we can move you!!!!!! 7 of us, meals half finished, etc. REALLY!?!?!?!??!?! No
option of asking the rude group to turn their conversation down or the more polite mannerly thing suggest they have their conversation outside.

FOOD: We ordered the hot wings to start and they were pretty good. A nice crisp with the sauce not too thick or to tangy to go well with the ranch. Their bread was standard, nothing special. I ordered the California burger where this place loses a point. It started off great with a nice tasty medium rare patty with avocados cheese and nicely grilled mushrooms. Also served with fresh lettuce tomatoes and red onions. The first half of my burger was very good. All the flavors melting together with the avocado being the key. It started a slight turn halfway through. Maybe I ate all the avocado in the beginning but it slowly became too salty. With each bite adding onto the saltiness. The fries were great: perfectly fried with a light salt. I also had a little of my brothers asiago chicken which was very good. Breaded and fried well with the chicken still moist topped with cheese.

The service was good too. Our server was very friendly and accommodating. It's also pretty cool that they are mindful of the drought serving water only upon request. I've also been here before for their Mac and cheese which is HEAVY but excellent.",4.0,2014-08-31,0.139,0.404,0.456,249
288,Matt Y.,"4/12/14  Dinner

3.5*  Saturday night our usual place, Elephant Bar in Burlingame, was completely cray cray with a 90-minute wait even for two and there was a waitlist for bar. So plan B was some place near Tanforan since we had to hit Target and Barnes & Noble. Jack's came in mind.

It was busy alright but there was almost no wait. We were sated almost instantly. Jack's is like a higher-end diner with a lounge's atmosphere. It feels a bit claustrophobic and noisy. Server Donna is quick to our service and friendly. They have very tasty Whiskey Sour ($6) and Belvedere Cosmopolitan ($12) (no Grey Goose) so we were quite happy.

*Thai Salmon Salad ($14.95) has a big piece of salmon grilled until the edge is crusty, seasoned with light herbs. The salad, however, could use a bit more vegetables. Chopped cabbage and greens with shredded bell peppers, cherry tomatoes, and rick sticks. Chili dressing very appetizing.

*Shrimp Scampi Pasta with Creamy Garlic Sauce ($14.95) also comes with a generous portion of crispy grilled prawns. Spaghetti is al dente. 

The menu here is gargantuan, from bar food, salads, comfort food, pizzas, pastas, to full entrees like filet mignon. Something for everyone. It does get very busy so there might be a bit of a wait for food. Food is decent not great, but enough when you have to take a break from shopping.",3.0,2014-04-17,0.559,0.287,0.154,234

That said, I tried the Southern Comfort. Its two fried eggs, on a chicken fried steak, on a belgium waffle covered in gravy.  The dish was very good. chicken fried steak was crispy and tender. waffle was not soggy even though it was covered in gravy.

291,Mike L.,"After I first tried Jack's months and months ago, I was just about ready to give them a four star review.  I ordered their Spaghetti Carbonara, and it was pretty tasty.  All that panchetta?  Yum.  Each time I've gone back though, it seems like the food is has been progressively less impressive.  What happened?  

Since my office has dropped in a number of times after our first trip, I've been able to try a handful of things.  Based on what I've had so far, their pasta and mac n cheese seem to be the best.  Besides the Spaghetti Carbonara, their Spaghetti and Clams dish was pretty good - a lot of clams and the white wine/garlic sauce was great.  The California Mac (chicken, spinach, mushroom) was okay (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ne9IVmO5KFaevaKEHR-ttg?select=WtEN0--moZa1mj4be0-BuQ), but I liked the Bacon Mac more (seemed more flavorful).  Either way, we all agreed it was better that we had shared them rather than try to take on all that cheesiness individually.

Lower down the totem pole, I thought the Sunset Boulevard Burger I tried on my last trip was mediocre (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ne9IVmO5KFaevaKEHR-ttg?select=m0l8ttCFI5lVgVcrz4T3JQ).  I liked the side of Garlic Oregano Fries and how they used grilled sourdough bread, but the bottom slice got soggy from soaking up all the juice/oil.  Seeing that didn't really motivate me much to finish the last third or so of my burger, but it didn't taste that different than a lot of other places anyways.  Similarly, the Fried Calamari appetizer tasted the same as just about everywhere else, though I was surprised by how big the order was (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ne9IVmO5KFaevaKEHR-ttg?select=XjYeVtxwyt3F2Rm60R0IWQ).

If you happen to be there earlier in the day though, their brunch options aren't bad.  The Carnivore Omelettte I tried was decent and loaded with meat (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ne9IVmO5KFaevaKEHR-ttg?select=4EJNqgBJfYtCV9MgH4rAuw), but I thought they could have used less since the omelette was a bit salty.  Also, if you're hungry, check out the Mighty Moose (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ne9IVmO5KFaevaKEHR-ttg?select=q-XYWCPN5VbCaP6Mt8e3ow).  My coworker (who is also the smallest one in the office) ordered it, and the plate came out with a TON of food. 

Even though Jack's and its menu give off that chain restaurant vibe, I think it'd be unfair to actually call them one since they only have two locations (when does a chain becomes a ""chain"" anyways?).  Plus, the service is pretty good and the food tastes a little better in comparison.

He was rude and impatient, he didn't feel like answering any of our questions about the menu. When I called him over to order my drink I lost my place on the menu and he just walked away. I'm so disappointed and disgusted by how rudely we were treated. The managers really need to do a serious staff evaluation because this is unacceptable for restaurant hospitality.

The only complaint I have is that the wait is usually long - a testament to how popular this place is. A little secret though, which not many people know about...they take reservations! We've walked straight in before, right through an entire crowd of people. I even noticed a lady complaining that we just walked right in. She was shot down by the hostess saying we had reservations. Sweet!

Anyway, I've had about half the menu here. And every single thing was very very good. Highlights? Happy hour beers, nachos, and calamari are very good. Of course, when I'm putting down some beers with good people, anything is good. But seriously, they making amazing lamb burgers here. Very juicy, but if you order, ask for it med rare. I've ordered it medium, and it's a touch overcooked but still juicy. Their meatloaf is awesome, and their mediterranean plate is really authentic too. 

I think the best time to go is breakfast. Their portions are garages. My fave is the Jacks omellette with avocado and hash browns. I've also had the steak and eggs and waffles....all so good. I'm a friggin fatty. Stop me now! And whatever coffee they brew, blows away some of the 3 dollar cups in the City.

299,Howie C.,"If I could I would give Jack's 10 stars instead of 5 stars. Friends have told me about Jack's and we finally went to Jack's for brunch today. From the moment we walked into the restaurant, the hostess was FANTASTIC, warm, friendly, full of smiles. Then we were seated after a 5 minute wait, which was quick since they were busy. We were seated and not long, our server Sean came to greet us, he was AWESOME, super friendly,EXCELLENT customer service. I noticed the menu looked very similar to Boulevard Cafe from Daly CIty (we have eaten there for many years until we received horrible services, and we have stop going there for a few years even though its closer to our house, and when Billy P the owner, lied about my review in his response to me.) We ordered our food and not longer after that, I assume it was the manager, she came by and welcome us and ask if everything was okay,we said yes and thank her. The food was excellent, I ordered the california burger, and the swedish pancake which I love (had it at Boulevard Cafe and it was excellent, and found out that the owners of Jack's designed the menu at Boulevard Cafe). I had a few specific request with my food, and they got EVERYTHING right. What was even better than the delicious food, was the SERVICE. OMG, the SERVICE from the hostess, to our great server Sean, to the staff that brought us the food, to the manager who came by to check on us was absolutely AMAZING. The food was great, but even if the food was not great, I would still come back for the great SERVICE. The owners and staff got it SOOOOO right, when we go out to eat we want good food, but most importantly we want to be waited on and received great service. I also love the story on the menu of how the 3 brothers decided to name the restaurant Jack after the son of one of the owners, it was funny. There are many great restaurants in san Francisco where we live, but it was SOOOO worth the drive down to San Bruno and we will come back again. I would highly recommend Jack's.",5.0,2018-10-21,0.357,0.524,0.119,381

They have great happy hour deals (a drink, salad/soup, and entree for $15!) and a nice selection of local beers.  Now...if only their food was slightly better.  The mac n cheese with hotdogs is slightly notable, delicious and rich, though I doubt I could eat half of the serving.

I think it was better than your average fancy burger and I especially liked the sourdough. Also had the wedge salad; felt the blue cheese dressing was not well mixed/balanced, and a bit overwhelming. Would say 3.5 stars, but rounding up to four because of their rather extensive gluten-free menu (for my friend that I dined with) and their cheesily delicious mac-and-cheese options.",4.0,2016-04-07,0.256,0.477,0.267,80

The Mediterranean plate with hummus, tabouli, chicken souvlaki, and tzatziki sauce came with large olives and pita bread. It was more than enough especially after sampling everyone else's meal. We had two orders of the Mac N' Cheese, one plain and one California with mushrooms, chicken and spinach. The last meal was Greek pasta with a Greek salad. Delicious. I also had a cup of barley soup and the meat melted in my mouth. We had beer and sangria. Yum. 

Great prices. Nice atmosphere. Wonderful waitress, Alexa, so helpful, kind, and attentive. Be sure to read the back of the menu about how the brothers started the business. Laugh out loud funny!

Their wait staff is always courteous, the food is reasonably priced and the quality of ingredients is on the higher end. 

I've had the Cobb salad, the roasted double chicken breast, the Caesar salad and breakfast many times there. All of which were very good. 

I've never waited more than 10 minutes for a table...even without a reservation on mother's day (with friends). They are keenly aware of customers and their satisfaction. 

The decor is classy, the bar area is hip, the music is timeless. The kitchen area is viewable too, so you can see just how detail oriented & clean they are. 

I would definitely recommend Jack's.

316,Matt G.,"Fifteen of my colleagues came here, which is located across the street from the Tanforan Shopping Center, for a go-away party. 

One of my colleagues is leaving the agency to take a similar position in Southern California. He invited fifteen of his closest colleagues including myself to take over the restaurant's bar area most of Saturday night, which seats twelve. And Saturday nights is usually one of the restaurant's busiest nights. I do have empathy for the other people waiting to dine at the bar area. ""No, I lied. I don't!""

At the bar area, most of my colleagues were sipping on $20.00 monster shots of Remy Martin XO in a fancy snifter glass.

Being a wimp as I usually am, I only had one shot of the higher-end cognac. In my younger days, I would drink the whole bottle in one night-but not anymore at the age of 40. 

Amid, we were sipping on other cocktails. I had a Rum and Coke. For $6.00, Joel (one of our bartenders) uses Sailor Jerry Spiced Rum mixed with coke. Most bars would just use Barcardi or other lower end rum, but you can't go wrong with Sailor Jerry's. 

I was also looking at the menu for a future visit-hopefully soon with my daughter. One of the items that caught my pair of eyes is the Pumpkin Bread pudding. For $6.00, the dessert is consisted of pumpkin flavor bread soaked, baked with a sweet sauce and soaked pudding. The dessert is served in a catalan dish and topped with whipped cream. Whether you're sober or drunk (like me), this treat is definitely a must have. So save room for this sweet treat.

317,Ryan L.,"Pretty packed around lunchtime usually during the weekdays.. but moving on from that to what really matters: 

FOOD : Portion sizes are generous. Food-coma inducing generous.  They have an expansive menu, but I can only comment on their lunch menus since I have yet to dine here during an evening.

SERVICE: As good as can be expected!  Food also arrives at your table fairly timely.

PARKING: They DO have an unpaved lot that is sort of adjacent to the usual communal parking lots that are shared by multiple businesses.  So, if you are ever wondering where are all the cars of ALL the people that eat here when it is incredibly busy...well, there you have it.

4 stars for the great food, generous portions, great service, and just reserving that last star because, well, as nice as this place is there are places that are still more upscale, classier, and tastier than this.

319,Cherylynn N.,"JACK'S IN A NUTSHELL: POOR QUALITY INGREDIENTS & POORLY EXECUTED DISHES!

Jack's is a prime example of WHY I rarely venture out of SF to eat. It looks promising from the outside with its sleek and modern décor and the crowd of people waiting (probably because there's no better choices nearby), but then you have to remind yourself that San Bruno lacks ""quality"" restaurants and Jack's is no exception. Call me a food snob, but neighboring BJ's, Red Lobster and Red Robin is just glorified processed food drenched in oil and coated in salt. :X

On Friday, 7.15.11, my friends and I came to Jack's for Happy Hour and decided to have dinner there too. The wait was about 30 minutes for a table at 6:30 PM. Rick, one of the bartenders is awesome and serves a stiff drink. If you're going to go to Jack's, go there for the bar and nothing else. I have a high alcohol tolerance and one Hendrick's Tonic got me into a happy buzzed state until I tasted the food.

*FRIED CALAMARI w/ Chipotle Tartar Sauce & Cocktail Sauce ($8.50): 3 STARS
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ne9IVmO5KFaevaKEHR-ttg?select=wDeE3q7DbWwdWD3TFX8xBw
The calamari was mediocre. Although it was crunchy, I didn't care for the batter because it was too heavy for my liking and over seasoned so you couldn't really taste the calamari. The tartar sauce was savory and cream but it lacked tang and I couldn't detect any heat from the chipotle. 

*HOT DOG MAC 'N CHEESE ($8.95): 2 STARS
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ne9IVmO5KFaevaKEHR-ttg?select=i_GEuIjQNOtfJD-l1ahtcw
Although the mac 'n cheese looked sinfully good, it was bland, oily and greasy. There wasn't much béchamel sauce (if any), so it lacked a milky creaminess; it was like elbow noodles topped with melted cheese. As it started to cool, the cheese released its oils making it unappetizingly greasy. The sliced hot dog slices gave a bite of saltiness but was dry.

*GRILLED DOUBLE-PORK CHOP w/ Sweet Potato Roasted Corn Hash, Sautéed Spinach & Dry Cherry Port Wine Demi-Glace ($18.95): 2 STARS
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ne9IVmO5KFaevaKEHR-ttg?select=oAf_EKDcOhH65XjNeAwI4w
Presentation wise, the pork chop looked delicious but it was nothing but. The most flavorful bite was the edge which was rimmed with fat. The rest of the pork chop was flavorless, tough and drying to the throat, even the demi-glaze couldn't save it. The best thing on the plate was the sweet potato roasted corn hash which was a genius combination. The sweet potato was nicely crisp and the corn provided a pop of sweetness; together it was deliciously savory and sweet. 

My friends' entrees didn't fair well either. My friend's pot roast tasted like a salt lick from a Dinty Moore's can, my other friend's steak tasted like shoe leather and my other friend's seafood pasta was fishy and had sand in the mussels!

S E R V I C E
Friendly albeit artificial. HOWEVER, the time mismanagement in the kitchen caused for a painstakingly S-L-O-W and fustrating dinner service.

Our apps came out within 10 minutes, but it took ONE HOUR to get our entrees and that was after we finished our apps! Even then, we didn't get all our entrees at the same time and my friend's steak was cooked well-done instead of medium. He sent it back to the kitchen and our waiter said it would take 4 minutes, but it took 17 minutes and they STILL managed to overcook it to a leathery well-done (evident of poor quality beef). 

It's very rare that my friends and I would send a dish back much less complain to management, but one of my friends thought he should offer the kitchen some constructive criticism. The Executive Chef came out to chat with us, looked at our half-eaten dishes and agreed they were not up to par and apologized for our experience. One of the owners, John also apologized and offered to take our entrees off the bill. Although it was a nice gesture, we declined because we just didn't feel it was right. They did take 20% off our bill though.

Jack's is like a step above BJ's; more refined and classy. There's several flat screen TVs in the bar area. Patrons are mainly families and senior citizens. It can get very loud, so it's definitely not a place for a date.

Although there's a lot, it's extremely packed and you will have to circle around and linger in order to get a spot.

320,EL H.,"I hadn't been to Jack's in years, but they proved to stay consistent in good quality and service since the first couple times I went when they had just newly opened in San Bruno.

We were also happy that they were taking reservations now (they didn't accept them when I first went there), so we were seated immediately upon arrival.

I ordered the Mediterranean platter and my favorite buffalo chicken salad- both were as good, if not better than I had remembered.  Everyone at the table thoroughly enjoyed their meal and spoke highly of their choices.

Our waiter was a hard worker, very congenial.

The only minor complaints were the acoustics- extremely hard to carry on an intimate conversation with your table, and the other was that the bus boys seemed to forget how to clear tables- they walked by us numerous times empty-handed and remained that way throughout.

* The MIGHTY MOOSE. This beast will grow some hair on your chest!

-  Glorious bacon layered on top of 4 dense KFC like biscuits, hash browns, tomato, two sunny side up eggs, white country gravy and then topped with country fried steak. $16 for the price of admission and boys need not apply.

322,Vanessa S.,"I've only been to the Jack's in Pleasant Hill, so I was really surprised at how small this location is. I was here on Saturday, after the Yelp Sip-nic, for a birthday dinner. We first sat at the bar while waiting for our table. I ordered the Jack's Sweet Tea, which I do not recommend. It just didn't seem right. 

It didn't take to long for us to get seated (there were about 10 of us). Our waitress did take a long time to come to the table and take our order. I ended up ordering the Chili Nachos as an appetizer and the Italian Mac and Cheese. After ordering, I got up and went to the restroom. I was pretty surprised that the nachos were already at the table when I got back. The nachos weren't bad and I ended up eating most of it (I have no shame). Eventually, I got my mac and cheese, which wasn't too bad. I think Jack's has pretty good mac and cheese. 

One of my friends did order the pork chop, but he asked for another one because his was dry. The waitress asked, ""Have you ever had pork before? It's suppose to be dry."" Uh, NO! If it's cooked properly, it should be juicy. Rude.

And since it was a friend's birthday, someone in our party brought a cake for dessert. The manager was very nice and he ended up not charging us for the cake slicing, which was very nice and he was rewarded with a slice of his own.

The most prices are in reasonable price. Some items are more then what it should be. I ordered biscuits and gravy. It came with hash browns that were plain and two smaller biscuits with gravy. The biscuits tasted freshly baked and the gravy was very good. However, this was not my first choice in a breakfast. My first choice was there classic burrito, but come to find out, they don't serve burritos on weekends. That was a bummer.

The customer serve was ok. Our waiter was nice and information. But when it came to drinks and refills, we didn't get that great of service.

They even made it lower carb by holding the potatoes and adding more veggies. BUT the centers of the chicken parts were stone cold after I got past the crunchy exterior. It was cooked but just really cold towards the bone! What?

So this was the second of two meals where food was served cold.

Third time (today) was the charm with a cheese-stuffed chicken breast marsala special of the night, hold the pasta and add more sauteed spinach. Fantastic! 

Perfectly done and so much flavor. Same for the spinach which was excellent as well. The calamari appetizer was also excellent with two perfect dipping sauces.

I used to come here every weekend for brunch a few years ago when I lived in the apartment complex right across the street.  Although the food at Jack's isn't exceptional, I find that it is consistently decent.  Today, I ordered a bowl of the avgolemono, a traditional greek soup with chicken, egg, lemon, cream, and rice, and the code bleu burger with garlic-oregano fries.  The avgolemono had a nice balance of flavors and its warmth was very satisfying on a chilly day.  The code bleu burger was juicy and the bacon was nice and crispy.  The first few bites of the garlic-oregano fries were really fantastic.  However, the fries were way too drenched with oil, which made me feel a bit sick after eating all of them.

333,Kitty K.,"Every-time I've gone here, the food has been good and the service excellent. What I really hate about going here though, is the wait. I don't mind waiting if it's really good specialized food (i.e. wings from San Tung or ice cream from Humphry Slocombe or southern food from Hard Knox) but normal American fare.. eh. =/

Items I've tried thus far
Crispy Fried Calamari
Chili Mac
Jack's Burger
Tutto Mare
Mama Eleni's Meatloaf
Grilled New York Steak
Grilled Lamb Chops
Pumpkin Bread Pudding
Butterscotch Creme Brulée

The Fried Calamari is served with a side of chipotle tartar sauce, cocktail sauce and jalapenos. Not overly battered, so it's pretty good.

The Chili Mac is just a classic mac with homemade chili and green onion. The dish is more on the cheesy-side than the chili-side so the cheese is the dominant flavor. The nice thing is there are small chunks of meat from the chili which gives the mac more varying texture.

Jack's Burger uses Angus beef and is topped with thousand island dressing, sautéed onions, and american cheese. The burger was fresh and wasn't over-cooked but a bit on the small side. We opted for the fries which wasn't too salty and were nice and crispy (a bit too addicting).

Tutto Mare is a spaghetti dish with prawns, clams, mussels, and tilapia in a white wine and marinara sauce, topped with parsley, garlic, and chili flakes. One of my favorite dishes here. Bold flavors that really wakens your taste buds.

Mama Eleni's Meatloaf was served with mashed potatoes and covered in mushroom gravy with a side of crispy onion rings. Unfortunately, one of my least favorite dishes here. The meatloaf was on the bland side and dry. I did enjoy the onion rings as they were really crispy.

The Grilled New York Steak is topped w/ gorgonzola butter served with potato wedges and sautéed spinach & mushrooms. The steak was cooked perfectly and had great flavors (actually didn't need to add the A1 sauce, which is a fave of mine). Sautéed spinach & mushrooms were on the oily side though.

For the Grilled Lamb chops, they use free range Australian lamb and marinade it in extra virgin olive oil and a lemon & oregano marinade. They serve it with feta-garlic potato wedges and sautéed spinach. The lamb chops were nice and juicy and I loved the flavors as well.

The Pumpkin Bread Pudding is a seasonal dessert. It's topped with cinnamon cream and was surprisingly creamy (felt and tasted just like a pumpkin pie) and didn't have the thick bread pudding texture that I was expecting. The ""cinnamon cream"" was just whipped cream dusted with cinnamon. I just ended up scraping it off since I felt it wasn't needed.

The Butterscotch Creme Brulée had a creamy custard with a nice thick sugar top that you crack into (which is my favorite thing to do). My sister and I finished that super quick, it was so yummy.",4.0,2013-11-26,0.059,0.143,0.797,496

335,Elynor V.,"I was there for Sunday dinner with my mom and daughter. There was a little bit of a wait and aside from the hostess looking like she just bopped over after school, it was a pretty nice place to eat.  Think of BJ's (at Tanforan) all grown up, plus they have an open kitchen so you can actually see the food being prepared.  Nice.  

Jack's prices are reasonable, not too expensive.  Service was okay, we had to ask for bread twice, but I forgot all about that when the food arrived.

We had the calamari and zucchini patties for appetizers - both were excellent!  I'm a fan of calamari and it's the best I've had so far!  I chose the prime rib for my main course.  Our server said it was a big cut and, boy, she didn't lie!  It was about 14oz and you could cut it with a butter knife!  Perfectly cooked to order with mashed potatoes and veggies and   Jack's is not stingy with portions.

This is a spot to go with 3-4 friends just to hang out or have happy hour with your co-workers, casual to first-date chic.  I'll definitely be back to try the pasta.  See you soon, Jack!",4.0,2011-07-26,0.1,0.48,0.421,204

342,Rodney H.,"Since my last review at Jack's I've visited them two more times.  Once for dinner and my last trip for breakfast.

I knew that I would be back again to try the Mediterranean Plate (14.95) that my sister had before.  That Grilled Chicken Souvlaki is hella good!!  Lots of flavor and they give you a lot (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=2I6zu5-CktW5QrRGbKOIpw).  I heard that this is supposed to be their specialty, so you definitely should try it.

When Lent was over, I was finally able to stop by Jack's for breakfast as they have a really extensive menu.   For Lent I gave up Deep Fried Food, Fried Eggs, and Beef, and the one thing that I ordered for breakfast had all three!!  THE MIGHTY MOOSE (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=LRgg0R5Ne7xxtldaLpxdhA) two biscuits topped with yukon gold hash browns, tomato, bacon, homemade country gravy, one giant country fried steak, two eggs sunny-side up and chopped green onion (15.95).  Trust me, this thing was good!!!  Definitely tackle this on a empty stomach because it's huge!!  I would probably compare it to one of the Benedicts at Hash House A Go Go.  I asked my waitress how many people usually finish it and she told me about 20%.  With those odds, I was really motivated to finish it.  And in 20 minutes, I FINISHED IT!!!  MAN WON!!!!

I would definitely recommend Jack's as a go-to breakfast spot. And if you're bold and super-hungry like I was, tackle the Mighty Moose!!",4.0,2011-05-06,0.098,0.156,0.746,239
343,Rachel M.,"I'm sorry if you've had a bad experience here, because I love Jack's! I've ordered breakfast, lunch, and dinner from their menu and all of it has been delicious and a nice size portion. They have two Happy Hour times...the usual, then at 9pm until close. First of all, if you come here for brunch...MIGHTY MOOSE (especially hungover, this just might save your life). It's also big enough for 2 people to share, I actually recommend that because it's A LOT of food :-). JACK'S MACS....Hella creamy with a lot of flavor, I usually get California or Italian. Apps....Coconut Shrimp is crispy & juicy, it doesn't have an overpowering coconut flavor. Comes with a yummy dipping sauce. Mediterranean Plate is a good amount and yummy. Dinner...Pot Roast was tender and flavorful. I never think to order Pot Roast when I go out to dinner but reading previous reviews, decided to try it and I'm glad I did! Chicken Asiago was really cheesy, but still had a good flavor with the red sauce. YUM. Burgers, can't go wrong. I can go on and on about everything I have tried there...My point is whatever you choose, I'm sure it will be yummy.

Staff has always been nice and tentative. Food has always come out in a timely manner. The restaurant is usually busy, call ahead if you can. Otherwise I haven't had to wait long for a table in the past. Atmosphere is upbeat, they have TVs so it can get crowded during game days, but it's also fun! Their ""sister"" restaurant is The Boulevard Cafe, pretty much same menu but I've had a different experience there. Cooks aren't as good, in my opinion.

A couple friends and I used to come to this location on our way to our Kick Boxing class in South San Francisco. 

Interior is ok, doesn't feel as inviting as the Pleasant Hill location, could use some remodeling. 

Service was ok - I remember our server having a bit of an attitude, and took forever  to bring out our drinks, and take our order. 

Food was meh, my spaghetti was warm, but my meatballs ranged from luke warm, to cold, to piping hot..... its as though they had one siting out, one under the heat lamp, and one microwaved at the last minute.

The Asian Chicken Salad tasted like it had week old chicken in it and was surrounded by wilted lettuce. 

The Mac and cheese was runny and had the consistency of instant mac ( it looked great but that was it). 

The Polenta and veggies was a simple plate. Microwaved polenta and veggies sitting in water and smothered in sauce. 

Breakfast was most disappointing. The biscuits and gravy was sub par. The biscuits were hard as a rock, the side of bacon was cooked to the point that they fall to crumbs when you touch them. 
The saving grace were the potatoes, they were fantastic.

It just seems like they have a high turn over in wait staff because no one ever get its right and is always ""learning"". One time I watched my food sit on the counter waiting to be served to me for minutes then my server looked at it, stopped, then pulled a wad of tip cash out of his pocket to count before grabing my plate without washing his hands. 
Another time in a party of 8, two people never received drink after asking multiple times, then at the end of the meal they bring the drinks and expected us to pay. 
Our most recent trip will be our last as we were blatantly discriminated against as we asked for a booth and after waiting was told it would be an additional 10mins as they sat people closer to the hostess age and ethnicity in a booth. Then the hostess lied to us saying they had a (breakfast) reservation, but we know they did not because they ask for a table and a wait time while we were standing next to them at tge histess stand as we were already waiting for 5mins.

I ordered the farmer's market scramble which had pretty much all my favorite veggies in it - zucchini, mushrooms, spinach, and artichokes, topped with feta cheese. My boyfriend got the corned beef hash and polished his plate, so I'm guessing that was a hit too!",3.0,2014-12-20,0.687,0.187,0.127,81

It took about 10 minutes for us to be seated, which seemed odd because I spotted some empty tables.
In any event, I ordered a classic burger (cooked medium rare) with a green salad.  It arrived about 8 minutes later and I was very pleased.
My burger was cooked exactly as I wanted it and the green salad was very good with the herb vinaigrette. The service was excellent and the restaurant was not too noisy.

382,Cate E.,"We have dined at Jack's for breakfast, lunch and dinner and have yet to be disappointed.  The food is consistently good no matter what meal you are stopping in to enjoy!  Be forewarned, though, there can be a wait, especially on a Friday or Saturday night.  Jack's is located across the street from Tanforan Shopping Center and can get very busy at peak times.  On our last visit (Saturday night), we were told it would be a 40 minute wait, but we were seated within 30 minutes.  I noticed that many people put their names on the list and then left.  So when a table came available, the group was given three calls (inside and outside) before the table was given away).  In other words, have patience and you'll get seated.  And have I mentioned?  It's worth the wait.

Breakfast:  my daughter loves their pancakes or their Banana's Foster French Toast (I've tried bites of both of these and have to agree, yummy).  I have enjoyed the Carnivore omelette, and my husband loves the country fried steak and eggs (a traditional favorite done right).

Lunch:  you can't go wrong with the patty melt or one of their burgers.  My personal favorite?  The Code Blue Burger.  My daughter has nothing to offer in terms of her favorites, since they still serve breakfast, she likes to order (you guessed it) pancakes!  And a word on their pancakes.  The adult portion is HUGE!  My daughter is too old to order off the kid's menu, and the pancakes usually get her through 2-3 meals (she'll sop them in syrup and take the rest home to enjoy).  

Appetizers:  we've only had the chance to try their calamari appetizer and have made it no further into the menu.  Each time we've had it, it's been darn near perfect.  Crispy breading, fried to golden crispness with tender calamari interior.  There's never that ""fishy"" smell, so you know it's fresh.

Dinner:  On our most recent visit, we had dinner.  I had the shrimp scampi pasta.  It differed a bit from the shrimp scampi I'm used to (heavy butter and wine sauce that you sop up with bread).  Their version had a hint of tomato in the sauce (almost a vodka cream sauce) and there were small bites of tomato in the dish.  The shrimp were both large and generous in terms of portion (I counted at least 6 in mine).  My husband and father-in-law enjoyed fish and chips (and yes, you can ask them to substitute the fries for garlic fries for a small charge).  The fish was just like the calamari, crispy breading fried to that perfect golden brown crunch (I traded a shrimp for some of the fish).  The coleslaw was creamy in texture with nice tang.  And I have to mention the garlic fries (small uncharge).  My father-in-law had those with his fish and they are a meal unto themselves.  The fries are incredibly crispy on the outside with a puff of potato on the inside.  Coated in garlic, parmesan and olive oil, you just can't get enough of them (warning:  due to the high amount of garlic, this can come back to haunt you, but it's worth it!!!).  My daughter had their spaghetti and meatballs and deemed it delicious!  A generous portion of pasta topped with two HUGE meatballs, covered in a delicious pasta sauce.  

Dessert:  we have yet to make it to a dessert but I have seem them go past our table.  They look amazing and when I see empty dishes coming back, I have to assume that just like the rest of their fare, they are wonderful.  We saw a caramelized banana split go by and it looked fantastic.  Caramelized bananas holding a concoction of ice cream, topped with whipped cream and cherry?  Next time, I must make room for dessert.

I do not think you can be disappointed with any menu item.",5.0,2016-05-08,0.155,0.181,0.664,652

After we waited over 5 minutes they seated us at on of the tables that was open since we walked in. LOL   Another group of 3 people who walked in just behind us waited just as long as we did and they were seated at the other open table.

I came by about 15 minutes before the end of happy hour on a friday. My friend and I wanted to catch up and grab a drink or two on the cheap! We got a couple of beers ($5 each) and some of their $5 happy hour appetizers. Got to try the chili cheese fries, calamari, and a flatbread. Enjoyed the fries, liked the flatbread, but my favorite was the calamari. Because there were no more seats at the bar, we stood at the end of the bar where the waiters and waitresses pick up the drinks (we were advised to) and then our food came out, so we stood there eating the whole time. We didn't mind it much, but the bartender decided to hook us up with a couple of free drinks for our trouble! That was pretty awesome.

I really like the ambiance in here. The crowd was filled with people in Giants gear (We were up 2-0 in the World Series at this point). I hope to go back and try some of the food some time.",4.0,2012-11-22,0.451,0.443,0.106,216

Well I finally decided to try it out and I'm so glad I did! I think it's a great restaurant where someone can find something to eat.

First time I went I wanted pasta and I got it. Delicious. Frutti di mare type and I think it's much better at Jacks than Bucci's! 

Second time I wanted burgers but Hubert did not. We came here so I could get a good burger and he could order something else- salad and hot wings.

The lamb burger with the aioli and cucumber lime. Ughs, sooo good! It's not cheap, about $15 but it was big, juicy, flavorful and unique that I goggled it all up!! The fries are also just the way I like them. Hot, crispy and fluffy on the inside. *mwah* delicious

392,Lauren K.,"After coming from a Giant's game I was starving! Being mothers day, I expected the wait to be at least an hour so I went to do some errands and came back in about 30 minutes. It helps that the location is right next to 380 freeway and across the street from Tanforan Shopping Mall. 

I was seated in about five minutes after I got back from errands and was greeted by a very friendly waiter. While waiting for my family to figure out what they were going to order, I munched on some delicious complementary sourdough bread and butter (it's not homemade in case you were wondering but nevertheless.. awesome!).

I ordered Spaghetti and Clams ($13.99?) which had a tangy lemony oil flavor with a hint of melted cheese and of course fresh clams (WITHOUT SAND). I hate when I go to restaurants and attempt to enjoy clams but stop halfway with sand in my mouth.

I also split a Mac and Cheese with Bacon Bits (extra $1.50) and it was some melted cheesy goodness. It has 3 different types of cheese and probably a little too heavy for a entrée because I can easily see how it would get boring but a perfect dish to share as an appetizer to better appreciate the burst of cheesy flavor.

The sweet potato fries are also a must especially if you're getting a sandwich or a burger.

Probably my favorite part of the dinner was the water cups. (I'm lame). They were bigger than the usual cups and I loved that because I never ran out of water! I probably drink on average two cups per meal so this cup completely satisfied my water drinking needs.

Service was superb. I mean, this place does remind me a lot about BJ's which is connected to the mall except the food does taste better and the prices are a few bucks more. They have happy hour so check out the menu online to plan your order out if you're food obsessed like me.",4.0,2011-05-08,0.158,0.308,0.534,340
393,Arnold T.,"""I am Jack's complete lack of surprise."" 

Quote from one of the best movies ever, Fight Club.    

Jack's isn't a ""complete lack of surprise"", but aren't full of surprises either.  Dishing up food reminiscent of BJ's across the street, one could mistake their food for BJ's under a blindfolded taste test.  There's something about the décor also that reminds me of a hotel restaurant.  Bun even mentioned that it feels like we're on vacation the last time.

I had my first Hangover here.  Not the real hangover, rather the breakfast they call the Hangover.  Since breakfast is available until two, I had to take advantage of it.  The Hangover is a beastly omelet-styled concoction filled with chili, cheese, hash browns, and pico de gallo.  It was very hearty, and isn't for the faint of heart.  The chili was excellent, but wished there was more of it inside.  Yes it was yummy going down, and yes it wasn't yummy on the way out.  Oh man...hangovers...

On separate dinner occasions, while most restaurants were closed, Bun and I ended up at Jack's since they close later than most.  We have made this the designated location to have late dinners if in the area.  At night, that hotel like décor I mentioned earlier really stands. 

My adventures through the dinner menu included the fish and chips and the sphaghetti carbonara.  Coming from a random o' restaurant in San Bruno, the fish and chips were darn good.  Batter to fish ratio was favorable to the fish side, a ratio that's the utmost importance in fish and chips land.  Recanting my sphagetti carbonara, I added bay shrimp to the plate.  The sauce echoed garlic induced creaminess and slams anything Olive Garden has.  Yes, it was gratifying in perspective.  Stepping back, I am comparing it to Olive Garden.  

Jack's beats BJ's by a second in the 100 meter dash.  A second is significant, but it's not an extreme disparity.  Much of Jack's flavor doesn't emanate a natural freshness advantage compared to BJ's that one would expect (at least what I'd expect).  The food has a chain food essence, hence the massive comparison to BJ's.  I like the selection, the ambiance, fair prices, and the food to a certain extent.  On convenience of location where options are low, this place is huge.  It's a very casual locale and that's definitely up my alley.  Basically, I like the whole package of Jack's rather than JUST the food.

Originally I thought I'd talk about Fight Club relating it to Jack's again to end this off.  A few reasons arise that stop me.  Bun says my writing can (in this case IS) be too ""long winded"".  Today I'm feeling like a lazy day.  Finally, the most important, the first (and SECOND) rule of Fight Club is ""you don't talk about Fight Club"".

398,Wanugee N.,"Jack's is what you might call an upscale casual dining place, perhaps an oxymoron, yes, but sort of what Applebee's would be like if they upgraded their food, service and ambiance. 

Actually, it is a place where Dad can make Mom feel like she is getting a nice dinner out (finally!), but really he can continue to see the Game on one of the 3 or so large flat screens while nodding yes to her incessant chatter while chewing on a piece of Strip Steak! I think he killed 3 birds with one stone! 

It is sort of the place that when you were a child, you remember fondly as a place your family went out for fine dining, only to realize later as an adult, that it wasn't that fancy after all. 

But Jack's is a good value, and sort of like a BJ's without the beer focus. Our foursome had steaks, I had Salmon. The veggies are fresh, not frozen, the prices are reasonable, the service is good, the decor is pleasant, and the TV's with the games on have no sound, so the ladies can hear themselves talk, which they like to do. 

The drinks are reasonably stiff, another bird knocked off by that stone!

Food: I've ordered the classic breakfast burrito, country fried steak and eggs, classic mac, French dip, Rigatoni di Pollo.  They were all mediocre.  The fried steak & eggs is bland, I've had creamier / less fatty and thick mac n' cheese, French Dip was just nothing special, rigatoni barely had any chicken at all.  I never know what to order because nothing is great, just good! 

Service: Service is fine.  Food comes out a bit slow. 

Price: For food that I don't find special, it's normal. Maybe even slightly pricier than what I'd prefer. 

Overall: I will always prefer other lunch spots.",2.0,2014-10-24,0.382,0.423,0.195,113

I ordered the ""SOUTHERN COMFORT - belgian waffle stacked with country fried steak and two eggs any style, with a side of country gravy"". It really wasn't a mind blowing experience though. The country fried steak and belgian waffles were meh. The scrambled eggs and country gravy kind of saved the meal though. I've had better at a buffet restaurant to be honest.

They cook it the way you like it and they're super beefy and juicy.  My fave is the California burger that comes with mushrooms, avocado, and jack cheese.  I keep my mac and cheese classic because it needs nothing else--it's so perfect the way it is originally, creamy, cheesy, with a crunchy topping.  Can't beat it.  I will never order any kind of fries here but their sweet potato fries because it goes SO well with their burgers.

It didn't take too long for our food to arrive.  The food was very well prepared and everyone enjoyed their meals.

They always have solid drinks and food. I have never been disappointed with their food or cocktails. We made reservations, because it was a Friday night, and we were seated pretty quickly. It was a little loud but its a Friday night, no worries. The waitress was training someone and she was really sweet making sure we knew who she was and who was going to be helping her. 

Drinks came out fast and delish, as usual. Food was marvelous, and everyone at the table got something different and everyone was happy. Cant complain too much. You are paying for a solid meal. Great food, great drinks, what more can you ask for.

430,Len S.,"Dinner at Jack's on Wednesday 7 May with wife and 4 other friends.

My reservation request for a table for six included a note for a quite part of the restaurant - and the hostess did place us in the 'back' room at a corner booth - that was likely the most quite pace in Jake's - but it was difficult to carry on a conversation among friends. 

I found the menu selections adequate but not that extensive. My wife ordered the SPAGHETTI CARBONARA and I had the FISH-N-CHIPS. Others ordered the HALF CHICKEN, GRILLED LAMB CHOPS, HOMEMADE YANKEE POT ROAST, and CHICKEN PICCATA. I think everyone was happy with their order, but it seemed the portions in some cases were a little uneven - the pot roast and half chicken servings were large, while the lamb chops and chicken piccata were less so.

Over all the food quality was good and the prices most reasonable.

The service was excellent.

But this group of friends will not return due to the noise level and the desire to have a conversation over dinner.",3.0,2014-05-09,0.557,0.312,0.131,182
431,Erica T.,"I came here on a Saturday night and boy was it packed! It didn't seem we waited all that long for a table, so that was a plus!

When you enter the restaurant, you get a chic modern feel. I like the open area and you can see the chefs working behind a glass window.

Now on to the service and food....

CLASSIC BURGER lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle 8.50: my bf ordered this dish, medium rare and he couldn't stop complementing the chef on how perfectly cooked his burger was. He didn't order fries with his dish, but tasted the other plates that had fries and said those were pretty good too! Overall, I think he was very happy with his meal.

CALIFORNIA BURGER sautéed mushrooms, avocado, jack cheese 10.50  No complaints here, the burger was also nicely cooked.

GRILLED NEW YORK STEAK gorgonzola butter, potato wedges, sautéed spinach, mushrooms 22.95: I actually ordered this dish but with a few changes (which the waitress was very nice in accommodating my needs). I wanted the meat medium rare, dry (no Gorgonzola butter). I replaced the potato wedges with assorted veggies and also kept my spinach and mushrooms. The meal was made the way I wanted. Meat was medium rare, the veggies (squash, zucchini, & carrots) was tender but also crunchy. Spinach and mushrooms was good too. 

SPECIAL ribs with fries and coleslaw $18.95: This was the dish I was iffy about, my friend had trouble cutting the ribs apart and on top of that, it seemed like he had to work to get the meat off the bone. I love places where the meat falls off the bones on ribs, but it just wasn't the case in his situation. We asked him if he liked it, he was just it is ok with no enthusiasm. 

The service was lacking, the server came to our table prior to our food coming out and started to refill our cups of water... I moved mine to where the server was and she didn't even refill my cup. Then later on my bf had to get out of his chair to get us a pitcher of water from the service counter and filled our waters for us. I don't think the servers are attentive to refilling cups of water.",4.0,2012-02-13,0.091,0.288,0.621,384
432,Sharon C.,"Food at Jacks seems to represent a roller coaster ride...taste/quality are up and down and never consistent when we go. When they first opened, food ALWAYS was on point. Now, meh, not always the case. 

I ordered shrimp scampi pasta and it's never the same every time. It's a crapshoot if the shrimp is deveined and properly cleaned. 
Fish and chips this time lacked flavor. Had better from here before. Carbonara was good according to the MIL. Food is tasty about half the time, disappointing at other times.

Coffee was barely warm when it came from the kitchen.


Appetizers and desserts are a strong point here... Always consistent quality!

Good place to go for drinks, barkeeps know how to measure proper cocktails.

Waitstaff... Some are great, others, meh. Not rude or anything, but some here need additional training and should realize that when pasta is served, parmesan cheese doesn't take 10 minutes to bring out. Or a bottle of ketchup.

435,Mimie L.,"We came on a Thursday evening and the place was pretty busy. The 20 minute wait went by pretty fast, considering it took the hubby at least 10 minutes to look for parking! (The parking lot is shared with other retail spots.)
Once we were seated, we immediately were given bread and water without asking for it. (Nice!) We started off with the calamari and it came out within 5 minutes. Talk about fast service! I really liked the chipotle tarter sauce. It had a nice kick.

For our entrees:
I had the petite NY steak, which was part of the ""Early Bird Special."" I was expecting the steak to be half the size since it was called ""petite"" but I was really surprised when it came out. It was a good portion for me! It came with creamy mashed potatoes, seasonal vegetables 
Hubby had the Grilled New York steak. It came with gorgonzola butter, potato wedges, sautéed spinach, mushrooms.

I like that they had a kid's menu. Of course, one got mac and cheese and the other got chicken tenders and fries. I tried both of them and they were good. I was expecting the mac and cheese to be better, since they have a ""Jack's Mac"" section in their menu. But, maybe the kid's version isn't as good. I'm just glad it tasted better than mac and cheese from a box.

For dessert, we treated ourselves to the banana split and we all enjoyed it!!! I'm glad the bananas weren't plain. They were caramelized and it gave them a crunchy and sweet(er) shell. Nice touch!

442,Aria Anaïs Electra S.,"When you are in South San Francisco there aren't many good places to eat. You can find lots of chain-type restaurants but nothing unique or creative.  But then there's Jacks. They have an interesting menu with yummy dishes and many gluten free options...even gluten free pasta!  Gluten free mac and cheese,  whaaaat?!?!?

(For a while there I needed to be gluten free or else I would suffer pretty harsh consequences, but then I found probiotics and now I can eat anything my heart desires, but I digress.)

Anyways, the food and beverages at Jack's have some thought, care and craft implemented in their design and execution.  But be careful what you order because  if you get used to some of their good dishes, their not-so-good dishes will take you by surprise.  Hamburgers, sweet potato fries, BBQ wings (with the bone), greek soup, greek salad, caesar salad, hummus etc are all good... thai steak salad (I think that's what it is called), some of the fish dishes, chicken breast, and anything to do with hot sauce (too HOT!!), are to be avoided.  

Extra points for cheerful, friendly staff (they seem to remember everyone and greet us all in a super-friendly way!)  And also extra points for efficient service.

If you do have food allergies, be on top of it at Jack's because I had several run-ins with the staff.  Those who did not know what gluten is... those who did not know the restaurant carries a gluten-free menu, those who would add gluten to your dish even if you requested the gluten free version, and so on.  They staff there is pretty young and inexperienced in certain matters, so be an advocate for yourself if you have diet restrictions.  They mean well, but they're still learning.

We all ordered beers as soon as we say down and it took so long for the drinks to arrive that the appetizer got to our table first.

We ordered another round of drinks and again, it took more than 10 minutes to get our drinks deleivered to our table. Because the drinks were taking so long, we told the server we wanted a bottle of champagne instead. He came back to the table another 10 minutes later saying he didn't have the bottle we wanted so we picked another bottle and five minutes later the server again told us the restaurant didn't have the other bottle.

445,Nathalie Y.,"First time here with my friend and we were definitely glad to have tried this restaurant compared to the others. We arrived here around 7pm for dinner and waited about 20 minutes to be seated. As we were waiting we were also looking through the menu, so by the time we were seated we were also ready to order, which we choose a Classic Mac-n-cheese, Boneless Hot Wings, Orzo Salmon, and Shrimp Scampi Pasta. After about 5 minutes or so, our appetizers were served and after a few more minutes our main entrees were served.

I'm not a fan of mac-n-cheese, but this dish was phenomenal. I think I fell in love with this dish because of the asiago or vermont cheddar because I practically inhaled that dish by myself. The hot wings were also delicious, and my friend definitely wants to try the Asian Hot Wings if we ever come back. As weird as it may be, the appetizers were actually more exquisite than the main entrees because the Shrimp Scampi was drenched in lemon and lacked a fair amount of sauce, while the Orzo Salmon was also overly drenched in white-wine and carried a pungent after-taste.

Despite the disappointment from the main entrees, the appetizers were definitely delicious, and my friend and I cannot wait to try their breakfast or lunch menu in the future.",4.0,2014-12-21,0.608,0.338,0.054,227

I'm kind of a regular here with my family. We go here after church almost every Sunday of the year, so I have a ton of experience here. I've been going here for about 3 years.

Their business is not bad at all, but like most it is not perfect--we've been forgotten at a table before, or our food was just not up to our standards. Some weeks the Corned Beef Hash is grounded well, some times it's grounded too much. Sometimes the pancakes are too thick, sometimes they are just right. There's really no consistency with their food, but the taste is what my family really enjoys, otherwise we wouldn't be going back.

They have great service for the most part, and they always address their mistakes when they make them. The people who work here are friendly and welcoming, and are serious about making sure you are satisfied with both the food and the service.

You'd think after coming here for 3 years almost every Sunday, I'd have more to say, but I really don't because I think I've said everything in the most straightforward way possible. Food is good, service is good, and if management can keep this up I'll keep coming back forever,

450,Diane B.,"I've been here twice in the past two weeks first for a late breakfast after my fasting blood test at Kaiser.  I got  ""the standard"" with two eggs easy over and bacon and wheat toast.  The eggs looked like the grill was a tad too hot, so they cooked too quickly, but the bacon was perfect and the yukon gold hash browns were soooo tempting, even though I told myself I wasn't allowed to finish them.  After all with these fatty  breakfasts, enough has got to be enough

Today I was Christmas shopping at Cost Plus and Marshalls and The Rack.  I told myself I should just go to In and Out or Jack in the Box, or the Filipino place in the shopping with The Rack and Marshalls.  I went into each of them, but I just didn't want to eat there.  I know In and Out is everyone's favorite, but, as much as I hate to admit it, I don't really like burgers.  I just like all the stuff you put on them.  This time of year it's so important to me to save the calories for things I really like!

I went to Jack's, which was surprisingly packed at 1:15.  The host took one look at me and said I'd suggest the bar, but it looks like you want to read (very observant, kudos!  I was carrying my book and so few hosts notice) so let me look around and find you a table.  Ordered the souvlaki (which here is chicken) and the waiter promptly told me it comes with garlic fries, but I could substitute.  I like that I didn't even have to ask.  I wanted the fries, but if I was going there to avoid fattiness, I felt obliged to substitute.  I got the slaw, which was a touch above mediocre, because the dressing included tasty dill and parsley.  The chicken was juicy and perfectly done with a marinated tomato, onion and cuc relish on top.  I just piled on my slaw and it all tasted great together.

There were several large groups lunching (holiday parties?) and one of them was particularly loud and obnoxious, but what can you do.  My service was prompt and attentive... got my check when I needed it even though my waiter had just taken an order for a table of about 15.  I thought between him and the host that the service was exceptional. $9.69 with tx and no tip, just water for my drink - very economical.

However the lava cake was meh, definitely not worth the calories, and there was no lava in the lava cake :( The dessert menu wasn't impressive actually.

I've never had lamb (outside of gyros or plates at the Halal Cart in SF) so this was going to be interesting. Surprisingly, it was actually really good! The only reason why I had to take one star away was because it was a bit undercooked than what I asked but other than that, it was good!

The meat loaf was pretty good, it had mashed potatoes served right under the meat loaf. You can also ask for bread with butter, and the staff will deliver it to you.

469,Deb B.,"Wanted to update my review for two reasons: We've visited many times and the experience and food has slowly deteriorated, and I hope they turn it around because they can't go much further south.

My husband and I have visited Jack's at least 20 times since our original 4/2012 posting. We arrived on a Saturday around 11:30am, expecting a very long wait to be seated. We were told 20 minutes, and given a buzzer - and were seated within 15 mins. Good start. My husband ordered the Southern Comfort with his eggs over medium. I ordered the Greek Scramble (my standard). We both had coffee and water. Our food came out very quickly; however, my husband's eggs were barely cooked (very snotty and not medium). He almost sent it back, but he was happy about the rest of his meal and very hungry. I gave him half my hash browns, as they gave me a very large portion; however, my Greek Scramble was really bad. It was if the egg whites weren't scrambled at all. It looked and tasted like they were just thrown on the grill at the last second, with the gyro meat & feta cheese not having time to warm through...for when I ate my meal, there were noticeable areas of warm and barely warm. This variance in temps made for my meal not as enjoyable as usual. Thus my review.

Our service was very good, and even through our waitress was very busy, she filled our waters & coffee consistently. Please turn around the quality of the food...for we enjoy this restaurant and want it to shine like it should.",2.0,2016-01-24,0.095,0.291,0.614,274

480,Heidi L.,"One word to describe Jack's: mediocre.

I've been here twice, once for breakfast and once for lunch and while breakfast wasn't all too shabby, lunch was extremely underwhelming.  The menu is huge...they offer practically everything under the sun, and maybe therein lies the problem.  If they focus on fewer dishes, perhaps the quality will improve.  

Lunch:

I had the ""Italian Pasta"": rigatoni, Italian sausage, garlic, basil, mushrooms, chili flakes, parm.  The spiciness of the chili flakes completely masked any other flavors the dish was supposed to carry.  It was overall pretty dry and tasteless.  I didn't eat much of it, but don't like to waste, so I  took it home and recooked it with some extra flavors to give it a boost. 

My friend had the ""Grilled double breast of chicken"".  DRY. DRY. DRY. The season vegetables on the side were boringly steamed.  Mashed potatoes were...mashed potatoes.  She doused the dish in salt and pepper.

Breakfast:

I guess when you're hungover, practically anything tastes good, but I do have to say I enjoyed the ""Jack's omelet"".  Also for whatever reason, the coffee is pretty good here, and they stay on top of the refills (woo!)  This makes me feel like Jack's is better as a breakfast establishment but they have a bar area and that would make for a lot of early morning drunks.  

I know now to only come for coffee and breakfast foods.  Besides that, I will look elsewhere.",3.0,2013-08-24,0.408,0.154,0.438,241
481,Heather C.,"WHAT'S THAT ON YOUR FACE?

Came here on a Tuesday morning, when we walked in there was no hostess so we waited of course. Five tumbleweeds later the hostess greeted us with a half smile that screamed artificial friendliness (you know it's bad when you can tell/feel like someone is trying so hard to be nice because they're doing it with a B%*&$ FACE). 

Initially I wasn't feeling hungry but that woman's b%*&$ face made me feel less hungry so I decided to go with the greek yogurt, something light and easy (and later that day had half of the turkey club sandwich). 

BREAKFAST 
GREEK YOGURT WITH HONEY thick, tangy yogurt, organic honey, toasted almonds, fresh seasonal fruit- I asked the waiter for NO MELONS (I am allergic to melons) and I ended up getting chunks of honeydew scattered all over my yogurt, luckily I only have a minor allergy to melons so the juice from the melon (that's now sucking face with the yogurt) did not kill me BUT definitely made my throat itch. =[ I wonder if I said the words ""I'M ALLERGIC"" would the mistake still have been made? =T The yogurt and honey together was really and the toasted almonds and strawberries made a nice addition to the yogurt, nice, simple and good. 

TURKEY CLUB triple decker with turkey, bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayo, sourdough toast w/ sweet potato fries- I only had half of this club sandwich and some of the sweet potato fries. The sandwich was nothing special and the turkey was as dry as The Atacama Desert, every bite was gritty and fell apart in my mouth like how old dried out playdough falls apart in preschoolers hands. The only thing this sandwich had going for it was the bacon because it was thick and crispy and like I've said a million times before, every thing is better with bacon! The sweet potato fries that came with the sandwich had to have been some of the best sweet potato fries I've had so far, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside (just how I like it).

CONCLUSION
To sum things up: I HATE artificial friendliness, GO WORK AT THE DMV where people give you ""The B%*&$ Face"" all the time because they hate their lives. Also, I've decided NOT give Jack's one star because the yogurt w/ organic honey was very good and the bacon and sweet potato fries were very good as well.

Came here for brunch and the moment I saw macaroni and cheese on the menu, I knew i had to get it. 
I got the classic mac, three cheeses and just so gooood. They bake it and so there's a layer of cheese on top that is just so drool worthy. It was around 8 bucks though... which is probably one reason why I'm docking a star.
The coffee was good. I think they use a more expensive brand/blend so it's definitely more flavorful and just has a nicer aroma to it. Especially since it costs 2.50.

485,Nick D.,"I've been to Jack's a few times for dinner and if I had to describe it to someone who's never been before, I'd say it's an upscale Chili's or TGI Fridays.

Essentially, the menu is good ol' American food, with a little flair.  Their apps are pretty good, we've had their Fried Calamari and their Coconut Shrimp, both which were pretty solid.  As far as entrees go, I've had their Meatloaf, Half Chicken, and their various burgers.  None of which disappointed, not to mention, the portions are pretty big so you can share or have some left over for lunch the next day!  But, one thing to order is their Mac & Cheese, they have a few different kinds, but I love their Bacon Mac, well because, bacon just makes everything better, doesn't it?

Their desserts are quite standard, nothing to rave about really.

The service, ehh...this is where they fail.  They get pretty busy during the evenings, which you would think would be a good thing but, it never fails where our sever (and we've had different ones) seem to be frazzled and disorganized.  It also appalls me that in the few times we've visited, I've noticed a Manager type would go table to table at some point of the meal to see how everything was; not once were we ever visited.  Maybe I'm just too cute for him to handle?  Gotta laugh...trying to be as lighthearted as possible.

Again, they get crazy busy during the dinner hour, no matter what day of the week.  With that said, that parking lot gets full quick.  I'd suggest going really early or later on in the evening if you can.

Menu is the exact same as Boulevard Cafe in Daly City. Lame shit. Food sucked too.

FOOD:

Ordered a Lamb Burger, medium, no mayo with fries --- I got a lukewarm lamb burger, well done, drenched with mayo and a bun that was saturated with grease. I wrung it out just to see how much oil I got. It was a good tablespoon of grease. Lamb tasted like beef. A cover up to a FXXKED up burger?

Fries: hard, no flavor, cold. 

Soda: The only drink that was worth drinking because I needed caffeine. 

Calamari appetizer: I have never seen a lake of grease that makes this delicate snack soggy before. FAIL.

I ordered the lamb burger with garlic fries and an alcoholic sweet tea drink to wash it all down. The lamb burger was ordered medium but came out a little more cooked than that. The flavor was just OK on the lamb burger. Maybe because it was ground lamb but it didn't taste too much like lamb. The garlic fries were actually pretty good. Loaded up with enough garlic to have my roomates complaining about my breath.

Ambiance is definitely nice but the food doesn't compare. I felt like we were all on a bromance date...it was cute.

Tonight I was really pleased with our server, cannot recall her name. She was very patient with my cranky 4 year old who hasn't napped all day. She made sure his food came ASAP, came back to check on everything and just had a super pleasant attitude. However, my son was about half way with his hotdog which I was feeding him because we were still waiting for our entrees to come and I noticed MOLD on the whole end of his bun. Yes, MOLD. WTF. I called over a waiter as soon as I noticed it and he informed the manager. The manager came over said sorry and made him a new plate. I'm not sure how much of the bun had mold growing but not I'm slowly watching my son to make sure he's not getting sick or am upset stomach. 

I'm very forgiving and can get over shitty service, overpriced food, hole in the walls, but for having mold growing on food, especially kids food is just unacceptable.

I ordered a fish filet as a replacement meal and wasn't charged for it. Ended up only paying for the burger and calamari; she even comped us our beers.

I can't tell you how many times I have eaten out and order lamb chops medium-rare and it comes out overcooked. Jack's lamb chops were cooked perfectly. You get 4 meaty chops. Nice reddish-pink in the interior, well-seasoned, moist and tender! The potatoes were great and the spinach was fresh and light. Service was great. Waiters and waitresses tended to us even if they weren't our primary server. Price was reasonable for our entrees. The drinks were also reasonable. I had the house wine, which was quite good for $4 a glass..

I would have liked better lighting at the table though. It was a little too dark where I had to strain to read the menu.

It was a Friday night, so it was quite busy. Good thing we made reservations. We will definitely go back again.",5.0,2014-11-15,0.193,0.477,0.33,168
508,Brian G.,"Ok so this is my second review as I've been to Jack's twice now, despite promising myself to never come back!
My office came here for lunch last week and as luck would (not) have it. The same rude manager lady was working. I didn't have my service dog with me this day, but she managed to give the same figurative F-U to my whole office. 
At first we got a table for 4 and a table for 3, but we saw open booths and only a few people waiting in front of us, so we asked for a Booth. The manager said 20 minutes, even though both booths were open. 
Long story short, we never got a booth, we were sat NEXT to the booth, apart from the others. One booth went to a party of 4, and the other booth NEVER GOT USED when we paid the check. 
Oh yeah, and if they didn't mess that up bad enough, by the time my cocktail and plate arrived, my co-workers had almost finished their plate. Thats how bad their service line is. I left a $0.00 tip. Yes I would have gotten ratchet on the way out if I wasn't here with the Director of HR that day. 
""Jacks's"" is now officially known to the entire building now as a joke, only referenced with a laugh afterward. Will stick with BJ's across the street going forward, as we did today.",1.0,2015-10-22,0.511,0.358,0.132,241

512,Ryan C.,"After passing by this place a zillion times on El Camino, we finally decided to try this place out. We skipped the DUBS game for this as I was under the weather but were pleasantly surprised to see the game playing on one of the TVs. The entrance isn't on El Camino. It's on a little side street, which accesses the apartments. 

It was a Saturday night and it was pretty busy. But fortunately as there were only two of us we were seated right away. The ambiance is nice. It's like a modern diner. The menu is an easy read but fairly limited. I wasn't intrigued by anything from the dinner menu. But the waiter read us the specials and made it easy for me. How could I pass up a 16oz ribeye for $16 with twice baked baked potatoes?

The wifey decided to go with a simple Mac and cheese. I would usually be disappointed with such a ""blah"" order but it looked good and she said it was good. The ribeye was cooked as i ordered. It was medium. But it was pretty tasteless. There was no salt or pepper at all. My plate also had steamed veggies and that was pretty good. Not over cooked at all. But what was axing was the twice baked baked potatoes. It was awesome. 

Overall the place was alright. So I am giving it 3 stars. The price was fair. But I am disappointed about the ribeye. I mean it was cooked perfectly but no seasoning? That's just wrong! I would give this place another chance but for now, sorry jacks only 3 stars and the stars are due to the service and twice baked baked potatoes..",3.0,2013-11-17,0.153,0.253,0.594,287

514,Ben H L.,"It happens very rarely but the thing that I fell in love with after having a meal at Jack's is the decor.  The room had tall ceilings, wide open walkaways to walk through, TV's tuned to sports near the bar, windows on all sides of the restaurant, and super heavy and fancy silverware with fancy napkins.  This place is a mansion compared to some of the breakfast places on Grand Ave. and Joann's Cafe on El Camino.  Sometimes, a guy needs a table where he can have some elbow room...and Jack's is certainly built for that.  The menu was not too expensive or expansive but it covered mostly a little bit of everything.  I got the Swedish pancakes for $7 and although it wasn't as good as my South Bay comparisions at Country Inn or Original Pancake House, their version wasn't as good but still tasty satisfying.  My coffee was filled regularly and our server did a decent job with us.

All together, it was a positive experience at Jack's and I hope I can come back again another time to sit again in their comfy booths!",4.0,2011-06-19,0.545,0.313,0.141,187

518,Fancypants X.,"Two month old Jack's has a large menu that resembles Any Chain Restaurant's, with the benefit of Greek additions. 

My party of four tried a mix of it all: 
-- buffalo chicken salad: masquerading as a healthy item, but it is one fat on top of another. I did not try. $12.95
-- avgolemono soup: lemony broth with chicken & rice. $3.50 per cup
-- regular mac & cheese: yummy! They have a few different varieties to choose from priced between $8-$10. 
-- shrimp scampi pasta w/ angel hair pasta: portion big enough for 2 people to share. Buttery, though prepared simply. $13.95 

Service: waitress did not check on us. Food took a long time to be brought out. We were quoted a wait time of 35 minutes (Friday night, 8:30pm) even though there were clearly available tables. 

Ambiance: overwhelming sour smell (Parmesan cheese?) in entire restaurant. Loud & lively. Mostly families, many with young children. Spacious. Minimally & tastefully decorated.

This is pretty much a more modern version of Boulevard Cafe in Daly City. Great location (right off the 380 freeway and across the street from Tanforan Mall). The wait for breakfast/brunch on the weekends can get a little tough but if you can find bar seating, all is well because the bartenders are super attentive.

522,Ula C.,"Review is only for Breakfast/Brunch:

I really like Jack's because it's literally across the street from where I live so for that alone I will be coming back here often.  If you do decide to come here and have brunch on the weekends, be warned, it does get really packed so give yourself time to wait...and wait...and wait some more.  The staff is very friendly and accommodating.  The restaurant is very clean and unlike Ihop or Denny's, you will not be leaving this place smelling like old grease (yuck!).  They also have a full service bar which houses a couple of TV's which is perfect for the bf.  

I usually just order these three things when I go there:

SOUTHERN COMFORT (it's the country fried chicken over waffles with gravy.  It's very good and the plate is not swimming in lard.  The steak is tender and crispy. The waffle fluffy. The gravy is not too salty)

CHOCOLATE BANANA PANCAKES (This review basically goes for all pancakes.  They are quite fluffy!  You can basically request them to put whatever you want in the pancakes like what I did...normally they only have chocolate pancakes. I've tried the blueberry pancakes too and they were so good!   Don't forget to ask them for a side of whipped cream...)

GREEK YOGURT (I know, I know...it's so simple and why order it in a restaurant? Because the texture of the yogurt is almost like custard...it's thick and creamy and they put honey and tons of fresh fruits in it! The first time I had it I cleaned out the whole bowl!)

Very attentive staff, especially the server, Ms. Kat. 

The coffee is strong, but very good, and comes in large cups.  Eggs cooked to order and crisp, thick bacon.  Tasty Belgian Waffle served with warm syrup.

Be forewarned, you may have to order some of the breakfast sides to your specifications:  The whole wheat ""toast"" is not toast, but warm bread soggy with butter and the hash browns are also soggy.

Think Lyon's, but newer and better.  They have a good number of booths (as opposed to tables) which to me is a plus.  And even though it was crowded, the wait was only 10 minutes.  The people there are pretty nice, another big plus considering how busy they were.  And they serve breakfast til 2pm.  I love breakfast food, but since I already ate breakfast I opted for a burger.  Here's what I pigged out on:

*Pastrami Burger:  100% angus chuck, hot pastrami, melted swiss cheese (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ne9IVmO5KFaevaKEHR-ttg?select=zvaiJUyD8vRjOJQQvbF1Eg)

*Bacon Mac-n-Cheese (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ne9IVmO5KFaevaKEHR-ttg?select=LgYP57VWdbY24sW5UXGoSQ)

*Pumpkin Bread Pudding (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ne9IVmO5KFaevaKEHR-ttg?select=pi3ZoKMdQzUFHsrnHkMvJQ)

*Creme brulee (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ne9IVmO5KFaevaKEHR-ttg?select=13Qfen9fJRb1hPtq87GkSQ)

Sounds like a lot, right?  Don't worry, I shared!  AND I skipped dinner that night.  Haha.  The burgers were both pretty good.  Tasty and juicy.  I'd say 3.5 stars.  The mac was just okay.  I'll go 3 stars.  The pumpkin bread pudding I gotta say was surprisingly good.  3.5 stars.  I would've been satisfied with that as the only dessert.  But then there's the creme brulee.....it was pretty damn good.  Kinda put the pudding to shame really.  Gonna go a solid 4 stars, maybe 4.5.

528,Jessica A.,"I've been here a couple times since their grand opening. Located right across Tanforan. 

My most recent visit was on a Saturday afternoon & there was no wait for a party of 4. 

BBQ Wings - YUMMM!! Really good wings. Definitely would recommend this :)

Pesto Rigatoni - It was okay. Kinda plain. Nothing wow about it. Probably wouldn't order it again though. 

Mac & Cheese - The kids had this & they enjoyed it.

They do have a parking lot, but it's combined with parking spaces for the condos next to it, other businesses in the area, & Jack's. Parking can be scarce when it's busy. 

Service was good..in the beginning. But towards the end when we were about finished with our meal, our waiter like never came back. He would go to the other tables & not make eye contact with us. We just wanted a to-go box & our check, but we couldn't get his attention. It took so long for him to check up on us that my nephew was getting restless & I had to take him outside. We were waiting outside for a pretty long time too. Kinda ridiculous. It wasn't even THAT busy either.  

I probably would've given it 4 stars, but because of the poor customer service, I'm knocking off one star. Hopefully I'll have some better service on my next visit.

Sorry to report that this is the second time this has happened in the last couple of months -something has changed in their kitchen.  Also had the pasta dishes and fish a couple of times and they were overcooked one time, undercooked the next.

Anyways a colleague and I came for lunch on a weekday. It was packed but we were able to score a table. I got the club sandwich with garlic oregano fries and my coworker had the French dip with sweet potato fries. The portions are huge. Maybe big guys could finish. But I took half of my sandwich home. It was a triple decker with lettuce, tomatoes, bacon, mayo, and turkey. So good but huge so it barely fit in my mouth. Haha. And the garlic oregano fries were really good, crispy and delicious. I will probably go for the sweet potato fries next time. Prices match their big portions. But service was just ok.

534,Peter K.,"I came here for a New Year's Eve dinner and they had pre-set menu choices (ribeye vs. mac & cheese vs. salmon). I ended up getting the salmon but I had a chance to taste the mac & cheese as well.

The salmon was super moist and tender and not undercooked. I was pleasantly surprised because most places I go to that serve salmon overcook it. Here, it's a fairly large piece and it has enough pepper and salt on it for a good flavor! It came with some veggies and a choice of potato on the side. I'd definitely recommend it!!

The mac & cheese was awesome as well! Take into consideration that I ordinarily don't like mac & cheese and I only took a few bites. However, the few bites that I took put me into bliss. The top of the mac & cheese is seared so it gives it a crunchy cheese flavor while the remainder of the mac & cheese is melted at normal temperatures. It gives it a really good texture and if you (in general) even like a hint of mac & cheese, I'd also definitely recommend this!",4.0,2012-02-07,0.04,0.119,0.842,194

- Food, average
- Prices, average 
- Service, really good 
- Ambiance, typical bar/grill restaurant spot

FOOD - food starts
SERVICE - five stars

The guys at the bar were really nice to us since we walked in. On point with filling up on our drinks and making sure we got our food right away. Thanks for the company, we were bored. :)

So, my homegirl tells me she has a crush on a guy that works here so we came here on a random Friday night thinking we'll say ""hi"" and then go to the movies. Only to pull up and my friend tells me she's never met him and just think he's cute. WTH!!! Funny. So now i have to play wingwomen and get her that number. We sat at the bar, great seats, plenty of room. Met one employee who introduced us to the RIGHT employee. Not sure what happened but we ended up drinking at the bar, chatting with them, even past closing hours. Awkward sitting a the bar chopping it up when nobody's in the restaurant. We ended up kicking it at another bar until 2AM and my homegirl copped that number. (Hi guys, i'm sure you'll read this. NOW you know exactly why we were there that night! haha). 

HEFFER-STYLE STATUS.

PRAWN COCKTAIL ($13.95) - cracking! I'm not really into bay shrimp but it went well with everything. it had tiger prawns, bay shrimp, hearts of palm, avocado, cherry tomatoe, red onion, cilantro and jalepno, dressed with fresh lemon... all served in a glass bowl-cup (cute presentation). I'd come back here and pay that much for it, why not.

CRISPY FRIED CALAMARI - gotta eat me some calamari when i'm chilling at a bar. it was pretty good.

536,Johnna S.,"I give Jack's overall a very solid four stars. It gets weird how dry some of the staff can be in front but I love their Cobb salad and they'll make it for me at 9:45 with no complaints and it is always top notch and made specifically to order. I am picky. So they deserve the five stars. I need to stop focusing on two bad things when there are multiple good things going on.

Their drinks are great. I would like to get stuck in their bar during an earthquake or something. You know, so I would have to be forced somehow to stay at the bar a very long time. Typically, I can't afford to stay at their bar a very long time, but if I could I would! 

If you are a carb lover the Mac and Cheese with hot dogs is tough to beat. Desserts are also remarkable here, but be prepared to wait as the table turnover is slow as hell. Call first. 

Breakfast does not suck, but again, be prepared to wait.

Also their Gyro is the bomb when you are having a craving for one and even when you aren't in the mood. I modify it to be without lettuce, because I like lettuce for salads only. That's just how I roll. Plus I am a huge pain in the ass but lately I think I am worth it. Five stars for myself also.

540,Heilala F.,"I had heard excellent things about Jacks, especially breakfast. 

One day we had company in town and decided to hit Jacks for dinner and it was an iffy experience. Wait was short, service was excellent (my servers name was Rosa) however something happened with my order and our food took over 45 minutes to arrive. My server was very apologetic and comped a few things off the bill. Food was average, I got a lamb burger... nothing to write home about. 

I decided to give them a second chance last weekend and stopped in for breakfast. Wait wasn't bad (it was a saturday morning, so i expected to wait) and the breakfast was good. The french toast was the highlight of my breakfast, FOR SURE. I would come back solely for the french toast. My waitress the second time wasn't as friendly as my first but she was very attentive.

I went with the mac and cheese, which my sister loves, but I thought it was just okay. Nice blend of cheeses gave it great flavor, but it was really oily and greasy. My friend had the tuscan chicken sandwich, and she said it was okay too. The bread was pretty soggy and juices kept dripping from it. Kind of hard to eat.

Love love love this place and have been coming here since they opened, not to mention I was local too which made it even better. Since have moved away, I still come through at least 3-4 times a month whether it be to meet friends there or share a good meal with my family.  
Recently went there a couple days ago at around 2:30 which is really a good time since this place gets pretty packed from 11am to 2pm when breakfast ends, lunch crowd back to work.
I ordered a steak sandwich medium well WITH a salad, vinaigrette dressing on the side and a side order of french fries -- my daughter ordered the turkey cranberry sandwich with a cup of soup. When our orders arrived, mine was all wrong :(  it was actually the steak dinner with steam veggies and fries, so not my order! politely advised the guy who brought our food and shortly after, our server apologized for the misunderstanding owned up to her error and then my food came back... wrong again! I learned from watching 20/20 years ago featured restaurants and how if you complain about your food, chances are you'll either find a hair, or some kinda foreign object in your plate that I didn't wanna take chances on although I trust this establishment.... 
I was given a bowl of salad earlier thinking it was part of my order and this time the steak sandwich was correct but only got a little handful of french fries which I had planned to share with my daughter. I didn't wanna make a big deal out of it because people do make mistakes but because of the fact that this steak sandwich cost me almost $20 bux.... should've been right to begin with! We did get compensated for the bowl of salad which was cool but, overall I would've been happy with a full side order of hot french fries if she had asked me instead of just taking the salad off my tab.",5.0,2016-03-08,0.626,0.231,0.143,351

And how can you not love a place that has about 7 different types of mac and cheese?  Only thing I'd probably ask them to work on is the salads.  Tossed with a bit too much dressing for my taste.  Meatloaf was really good - enough to make me sleepy after eating it.  Burgers, omelets - pasta.  Eccentric menu, but haven't gone wrong with anything on it yet.

Haven't tried any drinks from the bar - don't want to set the wrong impression when dining with the kids for breakfast.

Best Service/ Atmosphere/ Food I've had in quite some time. I kinda gave up on restaurants for a while, but I enjoyed the atmosphere. The servers were friendly and the food was very very good.

I had the lamb chops which were very good. Well seasoned and perfectly cooked.  The bread pudding was crazy good. I was going to get the baklava, but my waitress insisted I try the bread pudding. I'm glad she suggested, because I think I found my new favorite desert.

Jack's isn't a chain, but needs to compete with chains (Hooters, BJs, Chili's within 5 mile radius). Jack's stands out with quality food and quality service. The people here want to take care of you and you can tell.

Good for:
-Hangovers
-Breakfast/brunch
-Hungover breakfast/brunch
-GREEK YOGURT. Trust me, I looked at the menu and said, ""HELL NO I'm not paying $9 for fruit and yogurt"" but I caved because I wanted to repent for the previous night's debauchery and now it's the only thing I get. I'm pretty sure you won't find thicker greek yogurt anywhere else, and the yogurt blends seamlessly with the organic honey, toasted almonds, and fruit. Not to mention it's a HUGE bowl.
-Mac & Cheese (many varieties, including bacon and jalapeno)
-Garlic oregano french fries. Make sure you like oregano
-People who are fans of Boulevard in Westlake. Same owners, pretty much the same menu

Bad for:
-Starving people or anyone in a rush. Be expected to wait a whiiile for your food

Me and my friend came here on Saturday around 11am.  The restaurant was only half full but the host told us there would be 15 minutes wait @_@.  After 10 minutes, we got seated and I still don't understand the wait for the table.  

The service was ok , not impressive but not too bad.  

My friend got a corned beef hash onions, peppers and two eggs.  It looked ok, nothing special.  I got a Monterey omelette.  It was egg whites, grilled chicken, spinach, pepper jack cheese and avocado.  The omelette was soso.  The chicken was dry and big chunk.  I think too big for omelette.  Too much oil and the egg was overcooked and not flavorful.  All breakfast served with hash browns and the choice of toast.  Portion was big and definitely could fill you up the whole afternoon.

It reminded me of another BJ's Brewery or other chain restaurant. Chains are fine, but the service wasn't the best.

566,Arnold N.,"First time at Jacks tonight and I was pretty surprised at how nice it was inside.  Definitely a nice place to eat at with friends and the menu has a good selection of foods and prices for everyone. It's seems like a small restaurant, but it holds a good amount and has a nice feel to it since it always seems like it's full. There's only about 8 seats at the bar and there is no happy hour on the weekends so it's more of a straight up restaurant than a restaurant/bar. 

Comparing it to the other restaurants in the area, it's more grown up than Red Robins, a notch below BJ's in terms of everything (food, beer, atmosphere etc), and the food is better than Hooters...but you already knew that. For the booze hounds: The beer selection is pretty standard...if you want cool/different beers go to BJ's for their brews or Hooters for their selection.  

The only thing I ordered was the Chili Mac for $8.85 and it was just alright. It could have been a more tastier, but i'm not being too picky on it and would recommend to share it with a friend rather than killing it all alone. Big portion for one hungry person.

573,Jose U.,"The restaurant business is a competitive one. It's no surprise over half of the restaurants don't make it through their first year. I don't know if that statement is true, but it feels right :)

I say this because Jack's made a mixed first impression on me. They have a pretty extensive menu, and browsing through yelper's pictures of the food got me psyched to get my order. 

The food didn't disappoint. The service, however, was another story. I hate doing this because normally I'm a pretty non-demanding customer, but in certain situations bad service just stands out more than in others. How could it have been better? Well checking on us more than one time would have been nice. All of us received exactly one cup of water (no offer to refill), our ketchup bottle was empty. My daughter's burger was pink, and then when we asked to have it cooked longer we felt like WE were imposing somehow. That is not how it should be.

Our server kinda pulled a disappearing act on us, it just wasn't a very good experience in that way. Then when she saw that she got a sub-par tip for the sub-par service she copped an attitude. 

I've seen ""Waiting"" and I agree: you don't f***k with the people who handle your food. But if you don't treat your customers well: they won't be back.

I've been here before time and time again, it's always great with the way that they are nice, prompt and very much respectful. Today we got two things, I got a polenta dish and my friend got a mamas elena's meatloaf. The food was great, mine was very creamy soft and crunchy while my friends was moist, crunchy with onion rings, an a soft fluffy potato mash. It was great talking to my friend and having the servers an staff asking if we needed anything else along with refilling our cups with water, then while we are eating I found a piece of plastic in my dish. Now as a person who has worked in a few restaurants that can be a big offense, but they were nice enough to fix the problem and fire a new polenta dish along with a free soup while waiting. Then they astonished me even more by taking my dish off our bill at the end of our course, it is always awesome to see amazing customer service when you see that!!! I wasn't expecting that, overall they were very respectful for there mistake and did their job to please the customers at hand. It is a rarity, to see this exceptional quality service.

Jack's Restaurants and Bar came up on my Yelp app. We were kindly greeted at the door by a hostess. There was a 15 minute wait before being seated. I had the lamb riblets appetizer (special of the day). The lamb riblets were delicious. They came with a lemon sauce which complimented the lamb very well. Deciding on an entree was tough but the Italian Mac (parmesan, mozzarella, mild Italian sausage, sun dried tomatoes, basil, and chili flakes) won me over. I though the Mac and Cheese was delicious and filling. All of the ingredients blended well together. Jack's drink specials last later than most restaurants. In order to get the drink specials, customers must be sitting in the bar area.  We found out after ordering our drinks. Keep this in mind if you want the drink specials. Our waiter was attentive and very enthusiastic. He couldn't believe we found Jack's Restaurant being from the  east coast. That's the beauty of Yelp. He did a great job staying on top of our table. Jack's Restaurant and Bar is located in a small strip mall. There's plenty of parking for customers in front of the restaurant.

I ended up taking most of my order to-go. I ordered the calamari and the garlic oregano fries. Calamari was nicely battered and came with chipotle tartar sauce and cocktail sauce. The oregano garlic fries were pretty good and the fries had a good crunch as if they were battered before they were fried. The fries also tasted like it had bay leaf flavor so I'm not sure if that herb is also thrown in. 

The wait for four on a Thursday night was surprisingly about 25 minutes (I didn't expect a wait). I found a parking spot after looking for a couple of minutes but I expect parking to be difficult during busier days/times. Our server was friendly but he disappeared for quite some time until we asked for boxes + the bill. There are TVs above the bar and along the back wall by the bathroom/kitchen area.

I wonder if they serve this type of overcooked food to certain ethic group thinking they won't complain.
I'm giving this place 2 stars since they really need to improve on their breakfast and not just cook the food and think they can pass it on to their guest without anyone complaining.",2.0,2014-12-26,0.003,0.023,0.974,99

591,Minette C.,"It's funny because there are only chain restaurants from Daly City to Burlingame - we got TGIF, Chili's, BJ's, and all of a sudden smack dab in the middle of San Bruno is Jack's. They have the decor of a high end restaurant, full bar, plush seats, open area for you to view the kitchen staff, very San Francisco-esque with a mixture of sports bar ambiance. There were several big screen plasma screens plastered around replaying the day's game. The service was definitely up to par, and our waitress was very attentive.

The food was alright. I did enjoy the bread and butter they give you. I had the All American burger, and it was quite dry. I ordered medium, hoping that it will still be juicy from the light rawness but not oven baked dry from well done. I got the oven baked dryness. Overall, the food was alright, but I do appreciate the effort.

594,Ryan M.,"I recently went to Jack's on a Saturday morning with my folks and my family (wife and two kids).  It was happening in there, but that was expected for a popular place for some delicious breakfast! 

First off, after we were seated our server got us going right away. My parents are extremely picky about everything, but they had nothing but praise about their coffee. The server was also a step ahead of us with what we could possibly need for our kids like extra plates for splitting their meal, covers for their waters, extra napkins, etc! I give them two big thumbs-up for being very kid friendly! 

Our food came out piping hot, and plenty of it!  I had a very delicious Greek scramble and the others had the french toast, blueberry pancakes, and corned beef.  I had a chance to sample everything and found it all very tasty!  Not overly greasy, salty, or bland. Just right for everyone's taste! Even though we live in Union City, the next time my folks visit from out of town, I'm sure they won't mind the drive for some delicious coffee and breakfast!

After our meal, the little ones had to potty, do we visited the lavatory... Not surprising, but very thankful, it was clean as a whistle. My daughter even commented on how clean it was! My thoughts are:Clean bathroom, clean kitchen!

600,Alex A.,"A surprising Mediterranean flare to their menu along with American food. The pricing is average, but the portions are small. For example the mussels appetizer runs about $10 and you literally get 12 small mussels--if that.... We had a few other apps along with some desserts that all fell along the same lines as the mussels.  The level and overall quality of this place in regards to food and ambience is similar to a Cheesecake Factory, but definitely not the portion size nor the food choices--CF has larger portions and a much more extensive menu. 

Service is very hot and cold. We sat at the bar for 20 min before a bar back even acknowledged us AND he did not communicate that he was not the bartender and proceeded to make our drinks--Long Island ice teas--which after watching him struggle for 10 min and consulting with another waiter + both of them taste testing numerous times our drinks we were finally presented with our drinks which were undrinkable and not looking or tasting like what we ordered. In the midst of the bar back making our drinks--both bartenders returned--but oddly enough did not offer to assist the struggling bar back. 

I kindly inquired with one of the bartenders to confirm the the possibility of our undrinkable beverages was possibly due to the fact that he was new--to which he stated ""oh no, he's the bar back""..., seriously!? I can see if it was beer or wine--no brainier drinks--but really.... He did remake our drinks and service did improve--but ONLY after I made the request. This does not excuse the fact we were on a holding pattern for 30 min for drinks and no apology for service that is just wrong. 

In the end, I see no reason to go back when BJ's is more conveniently located and easier to get to (this place has a weird side parking lot entrance) and more importantly consistent service. 

It is too bad because I was really wanting to try other items on their menu like the Mac n cheese. Since then I have consulted with a few friends about this place and they all gave it a meh or thumbs down--so even if I would provide them another opportunity--I would have no one that would be willing to accompany me!",2.0,2016-02-04,0.235,0.312,0.453,387

We used the excuse they're new, we'll give it some time and try again in a few months. We have been back for breakfast recently, and it was SOOO GOOD! The service (both times) was amazing, very attentive to the customers.

My first time here was last night with family after a LONG day of activities.  For our group of 9, it was maybe a 5 minute wait.  Our waitress, Kristen, was very friendly and helped make our dinner  a pleasant one.  She was pretty damn awesome.

For a Saturday night around 9ish, the place was packed but we got all of our orders in a timely manner.  The food was de-lish!  My cousins kept raving about the bacon mac and I must say, it did not disappoint.  True, bacon makes everything better but they definitely pulled it off.  My husband had the Mediterranean plate and I tried the Sunset Boulevard Burger.  DELICIOUS!

For dessert, we tried the baklava... heaven.  If you enjoy baklava, you must try it.  Served with walnuts and vanilla ice cream, the baklava is not too sweet like most I've tried in the past.

607,Megan A.,"I am so surprised this restaurant only has 3 stars!  I love the ambiance - everytime I come it is busy, I hear and see happy people (both the customers and servers).

Really great atmosphere at the bar during Giants games!  I was here when they were playing for the chance to be in the World Series and we were having so much fun at the bar, the people in the restaurant looked jealous and some even came over after their meal to join in!  

I usually eat at Jack's sister restaurant Boulevard Cafe in Daly City, which I also love, so while I don't go here as much as I do Boulevard, everything I have tried here was delicious as expected.  The chili was hearty with lots of beef, beans, and flavor, the macaroni and cheese is creamy and delicious, and that time I got the pot roast?  I thought I had died and gone to heaven.  It was absolutely SUCCULENT - the texture of the meat, the garlic mashed potatoes underneath, fresh veggies, and the gravy was real gravy not the super salty white/light brown gravy that you see at other establishments.  

I don't know why everybody is complaining about the service - I was once there on a slammed Friday night (my first time too!) and while I am just an observer of the restaurant business, I thought service was quite good for how busy the place was.  The waitress's attitude was fantastic - I have seen waiters lose their composure when they are very busy, yet she was so helpful and sweet the entire meal - I was very pleased.",5.0,2012-09-14,0.697,0.235,0.067,274
608,Asia P.,"Jack's Bar and Grill was a nice yet mediocre experience for a Monday afternoon.
When I first sat down at the bar it took the bartender, with one other party of two at the bar, four minutes just to say hello and hand me a menu. Besides the slow greet he was very polite and handsome might I say. I do understand having to prep other guests for their meals, but I could've been glancing at my menu while you were serving them bread and silverware. 
I came in around 2:50 expecting to have a drink for happy hour, most restaurants start at three, but not Jacks. Of course they started at 3:30. -_-
I decided to bail out on the drink, now on to the food. 
I ordered the Angel hair pasta with Bay Shrimp and it was delicious. Although I told the bartender bay shrimp, the pasta was brought out with prawns. As I'm eating my food, another employee is expressing her frustration behind the bar and loud enough for us guest to here. She was nice as well, as she helped her team mate clear off some of my dishes and refill my water. The experience would've been a tad bit more pleasant without the co-workers complaining about their frustration with one another. 
Overall, I am satisfied mostly because the pasta was so good. Professionally, I think that Jack's could step it up more on the little things to become a four star rated restaurant. They've got potential if they focused on the guest's over all experience. I'd come back if BJs across the street was too packed.",3.0,2015-10-12,0.099,0.213,0.688,271

610,Laurel S.,"We tried this place out as a ""test run"" for dinner after my husband's graduation from SFSU. We had late lunch/early dinner.

I had the grilled chicken sandwich with fries, and my husband had a cup of chili along with their buffalo chicken salad. My mother in law had the veggie burger and we all shared a plate of their garlic/oregano fries.

The service is awesome. Our server was attentive and not snobby at all (aka not acting like it's an inconvenience for us to ask her to actually do her job). The atmosphere is pretty good for such a small space, and they have a somewhat secluded ""back room"" that looks like it could easily accomodate a large party (15+ people).

The garlic oregano fries were cooked well and crispy. I just wish the garlic would've stuck to the fries better, but that's hardly the restaurant's fault. The grilled chicken sandwich was delicious. It had a ""wad"" of arugula, which isn't a big deal. All I had to do was spread it out and everything was great. My husband said the chili was OK, but it's not a saucy-chili, pretty dry. The buffalo chicken salad was really good, as they incorporate the buffalo sauce into the dressing for the actual salad instead of just adding pieces of buffalo chicken and calling it a day. My mother in law said their veggie burger is the best she's ever had.

Recommend the early bird special. If you order before 6:30 off of the early bird menu, your meal comes with a drink and a soup or salad! Around $15-$16 before tip and what not.

First note, if you read all the 1 star reviews, almost all of them are from 2011 and earlier, which is when they opened. They have Def gotten their act together since then. Most of the complaints are due to one individuals mistake at the restaurant as well. (People need to put themselves in other people shoes sometimes to get life and what's going on around them!)

Where to begin... I LOVE THIS PLACE! If you've been to Boulevard Cafe in Daly City, then you already know this restaurant. It's the same owners I believe and almost the same menu, except everything here is a dollar more for some reason.

Get essentially anything and it's going to be good. To emphasize the quality of this place and the care to the food, they use sea salt in their salt shakers, CHECK! Any place that understand the quality difference between sea salt/kosher salt, understands that it's the small things that make the difference.

Try ANY of the mac and cheeses, they are amazing! We really enjoy breakfast here, as we do the lunch meatball sub. Side note, once we got the meatball sub, and for some reason, they broke apart the meatballs! Foul play Jack's! We forgave them for this, as everything is still really good here.

616,Rhia R.,"Jack's has been opened for a little over a month now. Not sure if there's been any hype behind this place, but it's been drawing a good amount of customers. It's located right across from an apartment complex, which makes the parking limited and guaranteed to fill up fast. Came here for lunch with a friend. They ordered the Chili Mac ( n Cheese) while I got the California Burger.

Both items looked delish. Although, I think they overlooked that I had wanted my burger cooked medium and not well done. Subtracted a star for that. I had a side of potato salad with it instead of the usual french fries. Good stuff. 

Today's rendezvous with Jack was so-so, but I'm willing to giving it another shot. I'll try breakfast next time, since they serve it everyday until 2pm.

However, do not bring any leftover bread pudding home since it tends to coagulate and look like orange vomit.

we got seated in a booth, and had time for their happy hour menu. too bad they ran out of sangria, guess it must be good. 

we ordered
calamari- i liked it, you can taste the chewy meat and the outside was crunchy and the sauces that came with it was yummy.
spicy bbq wings- MEH wasn't spicy but it was crispy at least.
sweet potatoe fries- eh....coulda done without.

got the sunset sandwich...burger..thing....it looked really good, cooked well, tasted good. but bf said they forgot to season the patty. but it was kinda oily.
fish and chips- it was really good, fish was soft and outside was cripsy and i liked it a lot, but we were so full. and had two full boxes to go.

overall we had a nice time, waitress was nice, and friendly. service wasn't too bad. the look of the restaurant made me think of restaurant impossible...only they were pretty busy and customers liked it here.

622,Jonathan H.,Decided to sit at the bar. Decent tequila and scotch selection. The beer selection is lacking variety. I assume a corporate decision. The manager (short Asian woman) is very attentive and helps out a lot all while still walking the floor and doing manager things. Very impressive. There are two bartenders one new girl and one that has been there for about four years (Donna).The new girl was getting berated by two rude late 20's guys who seem to think they know everything about cocktails. I'm a bartender and was eaves dropping. They were just being mean and their complaints were not valid. He told both bartenders that they didn't know how to make a old fashioned. I watched both bartenders make the drinks and they were made properly. None the less both of them kept their cool and didn't react in a bad way to the guys.  to you girls. I usually get the buffalo chicken salad. Good stuff. The Mac and cheese with bacon isn't bad either. Had the Greek soup. Really good with some hot sauce.

I ordered the spinach and artichoke Benedict and it was pretty good. However they really over did it with the hollandaise sauce & spinach. It was way too much and at the end of my meal there was still a huge pile of sauce/spinach/artichoke left on my plate. It wasn't pretty either.

They have a bar area and even in our cozy table in the back of the restaurant, there had big TVs playing football. We spent a friend's birthday here while it was pouring outside and we had so much fun. It seems like a more classy and upscale restaurant, and we were quite the younger group among the older crowd.

We started off with appetizers and the complimentary bread which filled us up so fast, esp paired the pesto spread. The entrees, however, were great! They have a $15 early bird special that comes with soup/salad and everything we experienced was good. The cream based lemon soup with orzo that came out with the meal tasted amazing and was unlike anything I had before. I had the polenta entree and it was topped with a lot of veggies and melted cheese. Everything else was presented great and tasted spectacular- steaks, fish, shrimp scampi, pastas. At the end, we ordered and they brought out a fruit tart with candles which they lit, cut up, and plated for us. Wonderful service!",4.0,2012-11-19,0.891,0.093,0.016,189

My personal favorites are the burgers, best to order medium and they will happily customize all your favorite toppings. Love the sunset burger with bacon avocado and grilled onions! The fries are almost a meal unto themselves, can't go wrong with either the sweet potato or garlic, crispy and not greasy. The bar is great too with the usual drinks and some specials, best of all NOT watered-down. The service is good too, courteous peeps that seem to know the menu enough to make suggestions. Only criticisms would be a little slow to get the dishes out and always a bit of a wait even when you can see open tables.

635,Jacob C.,"So I've been conflicted on what rating to give this place. The food is definitely good. And some of their servers are good. But their manager (shorter gal, long brown hair, lots of keys jingling from her belt loop) has always been dismissive and/or disinterested when I've brought up past order problems. I live nearby and order takeout semi-often. Unfortunately I feel like I need to clock-in for a job I didn't know I had because they almost always get the order wrong. I ask for extra sauce, no extra sauce. I ask for a side dish, soup, salad, etc and if I get it, it may or may not be the one I actually ordered. So I have to dig through my bag and make sure it's what I paid for. When I've gone back there is no sincere apology.  The high school girls at the counter have zero customer service skill other than saying a bubbly ""hi"" so they definitely can't resolve my problem. Since it feels unfair to blame the kids working the take out line/counter, I can assume a slacker management style creates slacker employees. Perhaps if the manager acted like a professional rather than treating her shift as a high school gossip circle then the kids handling the take out orders would feel slightly more obligated to take their jobs seriously. Overall I wish they'd bring on more of the good, mature staff that at least pretend to care about good customer service. Don't get me wrong, if you choose to eat here there are still some awesome staff members and hopefully you'll be lucky enough to dine on a night when the good ones are working.",2.0,2016-10-08,0.125,0.328,0.548,282

638,Erod S.,"UPDATE: October 2013

So, it's been a year since my last yelp review for Jack's.  And I gotta say, their service has been BAD lately.  I always had to look for our waiters to get more drinks and/or get our check.  It's not a big establishment, so I'm always wondering where the hell the waiters hide out at!  Do they have a magical door there that goes to Narnia or something?!

We ate there for dinner too and their lamb was overpriced for what it is and their porkchops are dry!

So...3 stars.  But, I'll still come back for some of their breakfast items though (especially the Banana Fosters French Toast + their black coffee is actually good and not watered down like other diners!).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I'm giving this a 4 for now since it was my first time.  And my experience was Good but not great enough to warrant a 5 star rating.  

Ordered Southern Comfort, California Mac n Cheese and Pumpkin Bread Pudding.  

Southern Comfort: Great Waffle, Great Chicken Fried steak and great gravy.  The chicken fried steak was juicy.  Gravy was yummy.  Waffle was great!!  But, I won't order this again though.  Probably order the waffle and the chicken fried steak separately...but not order Southern Comfort as a dish again.  Don't get me wrong, it was a good dish.  But it's not something I would really crave for.  It's more like something I'd like to try once and cross off my list of dishes to try type of thing.  

Cali Mac N Cheese was great.  BF loved it.  I thought it was great as well.  But, again, not something I would really crave for or order again in the near future.

Pumpkin Bread Pudding.  As good as it gets.  Really good!

next up though, I want to come back to try the swedish pancakes, the butterscotch creme brulee, sunset blvd burger and the tutta mare....

Apparently, it didn't impress any of us as there wasn't much meet on the bones nor was it spicy. The celery laid limp on the plate but I enjoyed the light taste of the blue cheese the most. The hummus had generous portions and was very flavorful. I loved piling everything onto one pita and taking a huge bite; the combination was fantastic!

I had the Chicken Asiago and it was good....probably a bit too much cheese on top but then again, I usually don't order this dish so I don't know how it usually is.  Other guys ordered their macaroni dishes which are uber cheesy as expected and quite heavy.  One of the crispy chicken salad dishes had a large helping of cheese on it as well which was a bit shocking....and funny.   All in all, its your typical American type dishes you'd expect at a place like this.  I'm sure they have lighter dishes, none of us just happened to order them.

Oh I totally forgot that I ordered a salad here and the krutons they had must've been made in house cuz they crumbled in your mouth.  Seriously, the best dam krutons ever eaten in my life.  I dunno why I'm dedicating a paragraph to this, but I am.  Order the $4 salad option, you won't regret it.

i'm very glad i did and my group of friends agreed. it was the first time visit for four out of five of us. and, except for the excessive noise level, it was a most pleasant experience. 

2 had the fish and chips. i tasted hubby's fish/chips and it was very good. i'm not always a fish/chips fan cause of the deep fry batter, but these fish pieces (loin cod) had very delicate breading, if you can even call it 'breading.' the accompanying cole slaw was good, a bit different, but good. ditto with the fries. the friend who had also ordered the fish/chips, loved it, just about licked her plate.

my pasta pomodoro was scrumptious. light, delicious, perfect.

the friend who ordered the fried chicken was more than a bit happy over her selection. and the friend who ordered the blackened catfish was happy with her selection.

our server was ""G$"" - he was awesome. friendly, answered questions, didn't rush us, was totally cool. hope he'll be moving to the san bruno location!!

the menu was quite varied - sure to please everyone. prices were a bit high, i thought. i was glad that my pasta was about the 'cheapest' item on the menu at $8.95. the fish and chips were $14.95...kinda high, i thought.

we met for dinner at 6pm, and the volume of noise from conversation of people trying to talk over the noise was deafening.

anyways aside from the wait, the food is pretty on point. as for what to get, can't really go wrong with anything on the menu. the omelettes, speciality breakfasts (mighty moose, etc) better than your typical diner.

why the three stars tho? just wasn't blown away by anything. the portions are huge which is a plus, but if they decreased the portions for more taste, think it would work out a lot better. the wait is unnecessarily long and this is also a turn off. i would definitely recommend jacks to anyone in the area, but i would temper your expectations because the wait time is misleading.",3.0,2014-12-22,0.106,0.726,0.168,153

Overall I enjoyed the food, but the thing that stuck out to me was the par borderline sub par service. 
I usually don't care if you aren't the best servers in the world. OR one of those waiters who LOVE their job and are funny and entertaining and ask you how your food is and if you want water a bit TOO much. But i got a weird vibe here.

The wait was odd, 25 minute wait. I clearly saw two tables sitting around ready. and when we were called we got one of those tables and the people ahead of us got the same one. they did not change once since they were cleared and re done so I was confused as to why we weren't seated earlier. 

Hostess didn't give a sincere or fake smile with a greeting just sat us and left.  The waitress was very similar and just took our orders brought us our food and left. The food did come rather quickly which was great. She did come around eventually to offer us water. but never a smile or anything that told me she was not a robot who hated their job.

I did not know i cared about regular service this much but I guess I do.

FOOD: I cheated on my diet and had a huge omelette and a country fried steak. They have a nice selection of omelettes and breakfast plates. I had the MONTEREY which had  egg whites, grilled chicken, spinach, pepper jack cheese, pico de gallo and avocado. Huge portions. came out quickly, tasted good. Although I wish they SLICED the avocado. They basically gave me half an said here you cut it, we're kinda busy.

I did see some greek yogurt, irish cut oatmeal (shout out to Ryan Reynolds) and other healthier options. Though, if they give big portions, would they give a Costco style serving of greek yogurt and oatmeal?

660,Grace L.,"I finally got to try this place out with family that was in town visiting. It looked like a classy joint on the outside and the Yelp pictures. It's nice but a looong wait. We made reservations for 7pm for a party of 6, and we still had to wait... 30-45 min?! With a reservation?! Granted we came on a Friday night, but still lame. 

They're waiting area inside is tiny, so we waited outside, luckily the have several benches outside to sit on, so that was nice. They just need some heat lamps out there and we're golden! I wouldn't come back on a Friday night or weekend if that's how it is with a reservation. Everyone that was already waiting before us went in before us, so I don't know if they understand how a reservation works at this establishment... hmm... 

Anyways this place is smaller than I expected, but then again I guess knowing how big the space and what is next to is, I should've expected it, but I didn't. I guess with the amount of people overflowing I expected it to be bigger. 

As soon as we were seated and opened up the menus, I had to take a double-take... my husband and I were thinking this menu looks sooo familiar! Ahh it's the same menu as BOULEVARD in Daly City (not the SF restaurant). EXACT same menu design and even items. A few items were different, but otherwise pretty similar menu. Then we found out that two twin brothers own both Boulevard and Jack's, and each one runs each restaurant separately. 

The similarities of the restaurants ends there. Jack's is definitely nicer and cleaner on the inside. Then again it is brand new built, so it should be. But also Jack's has the better cook, all the food that we ordered tasted SOOO much better than Boulevard. It was tastier and was more professional. I would definitely come back to Jack's over Boulevard. 

The service still lacks, other than when our food arrived and our waitress refilled out waters, we didn't see her until the end when we needed boxes and the check. Oh wells it is a Friday night. Oh yeah and this place gets LOUD with all the people and the fact it's one giant room with a partial partition.

I got the Shrimp Scampi and my husband got the Italian Mac and Cheese. We also got a plate of the oregano garlic frires and the chili fries to share with the table. Mhmm yummy. Everything was delicious, except my husband's Mac & Cheese was a little salty, but it was probably all the sausage and cheese, since it is italian styled. They could've us another round of bread though, 6 people with one basket of bread, really? So there are still things lacking but overall a good establishment.

662,Shana W.,"I've had top notch customer service the multiple times that I've been here up until tonight. My parents, daughter and I came in to dine here tonight and we were a few minutes shy of missing the early bird special.  We got seated, our bread was dropped off by one of the runners and my mom thought he was our waiter, as we already knew what we wanted to eat and were ready to our our dinner.  This specific runner pointed out our waiter, my mom had her backed turned, so she couldn't see what or if the waiter was doing something else.  But I told her that he was still talking to a family that were still eating and I told her that to give it a few minutes.  A few minutes passes and finally he walks by our table without acknowledging us, walks by and my mom says, ""were ready to order"" as he's passing by.  My mom asked him if they would honor the early special still as it is suppose to end at 6:30 and it was 6:30 on the dot and he said, yes he'll let us order the early special deal.  There's only a few items on the early special menu, but it's suppose to come with a drink and a soup or salad.  We place our orders, and he automatically assumed my dad and I wanted the salad when I said no, I would like the soup and so did my dad.  He didn't bother ask us if we would like the drink.  One of the hostess actually got us our drinks.

Our meals comes out, the waiter messed up on my mom's order and that hostess again had to return it to the kitchen and return with the correct order.  This specific waiter, Francisco didn't even bother to apologize about the mix up or anything.  As time goes, by our waiter never checked in with us on how we were doing or if we needed drink refills.  I had yet once again to ask a runner to get a refill on my coffee and my dad had to ask for a refill on his soda.  Once we asked the runner, he must've told our waiter because our waiter came back to refill our drinks.  I'm that type of person who observes things and to see Francisco the waiter be on top of things for certain tables is a bias type of waiter.  

I live in the South Bay and came up to the Peninsula to have dinner with my parents and to see the worst customer service is really disappointing.  I know it's the weekend and it's the holidays and it can get a bit on the busy side , but as I've said earlier in my review, I've come here and dined here multiple times and have received outstanding service, but tonight was the pits.  I've seen other waiters and waitresses tonight give top notch service to their customers.  Jack's restaurant, if you offer tuition aide to your employees, please let Francisco use his for customer service training 101.  It was that bad that I don't know if I want to come back and dine here anymore.

To my fellow Jack's restaurant peep's, make sure you don't get Francisco as your waiter, otherwise you'll get ignored!",2.0,2014-12-13,0.102,0.235,0.663,555
663,Rebecca M.,I used to love Jacks. Food is good and I've never had a long wait wether I dine in or order to go. Had lunch there with my bf a few weeks ago and my burger that I ordered well done was very undercooked. Today I grabbed a Greek salad to go and there was no olives in my salad. What's a Greek salad without olives! I don't want a salad with just tomatoes in it! Lunch break is short or I would've went back for my olives LOL.,3.0,2014-12-12,0.448,0.457,0.096,89
664,Mel N.,"Jack's seems displaced by at least a generation from the present day.  I don't mean  like the new diners trying to look like the old diners in the 50s that were trying to look like the future.  It just seems like someone dusted off a blueprint from the early 70s and didn't figure they needed to mess with it.

The menu is has several kinds of Mac & Cheese, which is nice for my daughter, who is a huge fan of the dish.  I had the daily special, which was a serving of Jambalaya that was generous both by being large and for having a lot of shrimp, sausage, clams, and mussels instead of just rice.

Someone told me that Jacks was a really expensive steak place so I was a little hesitant when my friends wanted to go there for drinks and late night eats. Turns out its a nice normal restaurant thats like a mullet. Business and fancy in the front, party and fun in the back. Food is really good (I only had some of my friends boneless wings but they were awesome and everyone else enjoyed their food too), prices are like Applebees and the service was great

Rick was so attentive to us, was fun to talk to (knows his sports) and even though he was rooting against ASU we would come back just to see him!

669,Charlyn M.,"Breakfast food here is solid.   We come here at least 3 times a month.  Usually on a weekend for breakfast.  

Lunch is pretty good.  I've tried most of the sandwiches, the pot roast, the mac&cheese and some of the Greek-inspired items.  

I can't give this place 5 stars because of the inconsistency with service.  We're familiar with most of the servers, but occasionally we'll get someone different/new, and we'll have to wait a long time for refills or the bill.  It can also get pretty loud when it's crowded and the TV's plus music is going.     

The food is solid & consistent.  Very efficiently run kitchen.

After hours of fasting, nothing sounds better than a big cholesterol-laden breakfast! I think that's okay once in a while. Mind you, if Jack's was right around the corner from me, I might have a problem. I'm already planning a return visit. 

My daughter had a short stack of buttermilk pancakes that was still a hefty portion. My husband had a bacon, cheese, and avocado omelet, and I had the Greek Scramble. It came with gyro meat and feta cheese, so I couldn't pass it up.  Love that salty goodness!

676,Jacquelynne S.,"Here's the deal, if this restaurant was in the city, I'd probably give it two stars.  However, location location location.  I honestly believe that this is one of the best diners around the area.  San Bruno is normally filled with amazing Filipino Restaurants and Asian Restaurants in general.  However, it lacks good comfort food and diners.  I mean if you think about it, you have: Red Robbins, Hooters, BJ's, Fresh Choice, Olive Garden all within walking distance from this place.  So yes, if I'm around the area watching a movie nearby, I'm going to want to eat here compared to all of my other options.

Here's my pitch:

1.  Open bar.  They have a full on open bar and they make their drinks strong.  They also have drink specials as well as a Happy Hour menu.  

2.  The people.  The only other restaurant with a just as good happy hour menu is Hooters (across the street).  However, I'm not a fan of a crowded room of half naked waitresses that looked like they are just 17-year-old seniors in El Camino High School and loud obnoxious ghetto guys that grew up in middle class suburbia but somehow made themselves believe they grew up in the projects.  Also, I don't need to yell across the table at Jack's in order for my companion to hear me.  

3.   The Avgolemono greek soup (chicken, egg, lemon, rice).  No joke, sometimes I go here just because I'm craving a bowl of it.  I absolutely love this soup.

4.  It does the job.  The food is the best it can be and it's reasonably priced.

678,Lachlan M.,"Have been here for a dinner and a breakfast, with the most recent being dinner. We had the flat bread to start, which honestly was a bit more like a mini pizza, but regardless was very tasty.

For entree we both had one of their Mac and Cheese dishes. I had the Italian and the other half had the Californian -- both of them were excellent. The Mac is very rich and filling, so it can be kind of a gutbomb if you eat the whole thing... and believe me, you're going to want to!! :) 

I'd suggest sharing it among 2 or 3 paired with some other things if you're not set on indulging :)

Service was prompt and very friendly without giving the feeling of being rushed out the door to turn the table. The noise level is about medium.. 

Jack's executes well on being a friendly eatery with consistent American style fare which I believe is what it is trying to be. The prices are on point and the menu has enough twists on the classics to keep it interesting.

The presentation of the food was plated out very well but the taste of it did not match. Which did it such injustice. It was pure bland and masked with more bland sauce. For starters we had the calamari, buffalo wings, and zucchini cakes. Entrees were the meatloaf, 1/2 chicken, chicken sandwich, and kids Mac and cheese. Kids love mac and cheese but this one my friend's son did not even want to give a second chance after the first bite! We all tried it and was quite disappointed.

684,Denise M.,"Quite simply I like this place.  But I like The Boulevard Cafe too - so that should make it obvious.  These two restaurants were opened by brothers, brothers-in-law... a family place.  And they actually work at the restaurants, so that makes it nice.

Very busy on a Friday night, about a 30 minute wait.  Once seated, you get your water and bread pretty quickly.  

Friday night, I ordered the clam chowder soup.  Very tasty.  Nice chunks of clam, though its a thin cream soup.  Not thick and potato based.  It was very good.  

The menu overall, is almost the same as Boulevard Cafe.  So, hubby ordered his favorite, the Mediterranean Plate.  Loaded with grilled chicken, hummus, tzatziki, tabouli, and pita bread.  Yum.

I decided on the fish and chips.  Not overly battered, light fish, served with fries, lemon wedges, and tartar sauce.  Really good.  Initially my fish was under cooked, but one of the owners came right up to apologize and redid my whole dish.  Very nice.  I was just asking them to heat the fish a little more. I guess unless they microwaved it, they couldn't really do that.

Anyway, both our dishes were very good.  Do we need to go all the way to San Bruno for something we can get in Daly City?  No.  But it's nice to have the option.",4.0,2011-10-22,0.532,0.239,0.229,224

Anyways, the bartender made a Brazilian alcoholic beverage which was delicious. I had an ice tea...which was huge! No need for refills on soft drinks I'm sure. I had the shrimp bay salad which I enjoyed. Typical salad but still good. He had a seafood pasta dish which was packed with shrimp and clams! If you are a seafood lover, that pasta is for you.

700,Vindy C.,"Jack's is a nice, clean and friendly restaurant to visit if you're looking for a great meal at a reasonable price.  I've been here on several occassions and the quality of the food has always been consistent.   Some of the menu items I've tried are....

Appetizers
- Calamari is fried in a light batter and the chipotle tartar sauce is an excellent compliment 
- Onion rings are always fried to perfection. Can't go wrong with these.
- Garlic Oregano fries are one of my favorites.  The oregano adds a unique taste to the fries but isn't too over-powering. 
- Sweet potato fries are crispy and delightful
- Polenta is on the menu as an appetizer, but sometimes I have it as my main course because of the portion size and how filling it is

Mains
- Asian Chicken salad is light and refreshing.  But be warned that this salad is fairly big... so sharing is suggested
- California Mac N Cheese is super cheesey and super delicious. Definitely try one of their mac n cheese dishes if you are a fan
- Angel hair pomodoro is simple yet satisfying
- Orzo salmon is chunks of salmon mixed with spinach and cherry tomatoes...but if you aren't a fan of dill flavors, I wouldn't recommend this dish because those flavors are quite prominent

Unfortunately, I don't have any reviews or suggestions for dessert at this time because I've always been too full after eating the bread, appetizers & the main course to even attempt a dessert tasting.  But one day.... I'll save room for it  =o)",5.0,2011-11-04,0.731,0.251,0.018,264

702,Tom P.,"My family and I were in San Francisco on business a couple of weeks ago. We had dinner at Jack's Restaurant at San Bruno on Saturday night, September 10, 2011, on the recommendation of the bartender at McCormick and Kuleto's in Ghirardelli Square. I'm happy to report that it was one of the most memorable dinners we have ever had!

We were greeted by Audrey, the hostess, with a big smile and a pleasant welcome. There was a short wait which we spent at the bar, where we made the acquaintance of Rick, the bartender. We had a couple of beers to cool off, then a really great round of Bombay Sapphire martinis. Excellent!

All three of us decided on the New York Steak, medium rare. Since we're all on a no-carb program, we were offered a side salad instead of the potatoes. Nice! It was a great salad, too. The homemade bleu cheese salad dressing was uniquely tasty. The steak was one of the finest steaks we've ever had. It was cooked perfectly, the beef was of uncommonly good quality, and the gorgonzola butter was the perfect complement and counterpoint. The vegetables were tasty, and cooked exactly right. 

Our server, Tatum, was very personable, full of smiles and happiness. She took the time to stop and chat briefly, even though it was the middle of the Saturday-night rush. She was so pleasant, in fact, that we asked for her again by name the next morning. Ben, the manager, stopped by the table for a personal visit, making sure that all was to our liking. He explained how they manage to hire such excellent employees, something you might want to ask him about yourself. We also met Katrina, who, though not our server, also stopped by the table for a moment to check on us, and chat pleasantly. Toward the end of the evening, John, one of the partners, came and sat with us for a bit. He entertained our many questions about the restaurant business in general, and his business in particular. He even bought us a round to finish off the evening.

But the story doesn't end here. The next morning, Sunday, our last day in San Francisco, we went back for breakfast around 10:00 AM. The story started all over again! Jordan, the hostess, smiled and made us feel truly welcome. We asked to be seated at one of Tatum's tables. Two of us had Jack's omelette, on John's recommendation. They were fantastic. Best omelettes we've ever had in any restaurant, ever. One of us had the chilled shrimp salad, also excellent.

In all respects, it was the best dining experience I've had since I was a little boy back in the 1960's. Jack's has the real old-time, personal, first-quality, customer-comes-first approach, a real treasure in the New Millennium. We can hardly wait for our next trip to the Big City!

A footnote: for both dinner and breakfast, when the bill came, it was surprisingly low, far less than one might expect for such high-quality fare. I'm not sure how Jack's does it, but I hope they keep it up!",5.0,2011-09-27,0.339,0.582,0.08,523
703,Amanda W.,"I wasn't even able to eat at this place. I was trying to get a sizable group in with 3 weeks advanced notice, and they were completely rude and unhelpful. Asked for the private dining room, they said no. Asked for a bunch of tables to push together, got a snotty remark, so I gave up. If you have more than a couple of people in your party, go elsewhere.",1.0,2015-03-11,0.001,0.018,0.981,70
704,Adam Y.,"When writing a review, one must take into account all aspects of the ambiance, service, bar and the overall dining experience.  We must look beyond the cloth napkin and embrace all that the restaurant is attempting to provide for us.  However we can not provide a restaurant with an excellent rating that is unjust and undeserving.  Jack's, unfortunately is one of those restaurants.  

At first glance:
The ambiance and decor do provide a sense of warmth and welcoming presence.  The tables are spaced appropriately apart and the staff is well groomed.  The room is in a dark wood color with the white walls to offset the size of the rooms. It truly is architecturally a beautiful restaurant.  

The Bar:
Well maintained and friendly, the bar is the only saving grace for this restaurant.  One would see that this area of alcoholic bliss for the masses as a nice refuge away from the work environment.  The bartenders, although extremely unqualified, are doing their best to accommodate the happy hour rush.  

Dining Experience:
In this section we look to restaurants to thrive.  To put their best foot forward and really embrace the restaurant experience.  Unfortunately the best foot forward this night was an old warn out pair of Nike's  that have been stepped in fecal matter.  How can I say such things, not being a so-called ""foodie""?  Well, let us examine each part...

Once seated we were left unattended.  The only attention we did receive was a plate of extremely hard bread and butter that was melted enough that it needed a sponge to apply it.  

After chasing down several individuals who claimed that our waiter was a ninja, he finally arrived. Disorganized, he took our order and never returned to our table.  One would think at this point our table was an island of Lepers.  Sadly we watched as he attentively provided beyond excellent customer service to the surrounding tables and paid very little attention to others like ourselves.  After about a half hour into dinner service, we were able to barter with another waiter/table staff for additional bread, as we saw that our journey to our meal was going to be several days.  We did our best to ration what we had.  Normally at this point one would say, ""why not just leave..."" Well we could have but the bartenders did their job in dissolving any hope of that.   

As we approached Day 7 into our journey to Jack's the food finally arrived.  Now keep in mind that after sitting there starving, any sight of food would be appealing, so my story may take a turn for the worst.  

The, what looked like frozen reheated calamari and packaged macaroni with Nathan's hotdogs slathered in cheese arrived.  We went at it like a pack of dogs on a bone.  The calamari was dry and had obviously been sitting under a heat lamp for a prolonged period of time.  As I am not a fan of Macaroni and Cheese (especially with chunks of hotdogs), I decided to reserve my stomach for the delight-turned-disappointment of what was to come.  

When dinner made it's way to the table, presentation was a key factor here.   One would think that if it looks good, smells good, it must taste good.  And the first two hit the mark, however the third... well, McDonald's would have been a better choice.  I had ordered the Pot Roast with Mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.  My friends had requested the Double Grilled Pork Chop, Steak and Seafood Pasta.  

Slathered in a sauce that one could only assume was edible, the Pot Roast was similar to that in which one could find at a local grocer next to the spam and dog kibble.  It was flavorless and contained what the Executive Chef called ""Broccoflower"".   After researching it, one could only assume that it was unripened cauliflower that had not been properly cleaned and used because it's cheap and bitter.  Chef Gordon Ramsey would have had a field day with this..   

After dealing with my friend's steak which had been sent back twice for being dry and tough, the cardboard consistency of the pork chop and the ""so fresh it has sand in it"" seafood plate. We sat in disappointment.  

The owner offered to comp us for the entire meal as it was sub par at best, however we denied.  I would have rather gave poetic benediction for the animals who gave their life for this undeserving meal.  However, the ""Exec Chef""  would probably not understand as he was young and inexperienced.  I'd do better giving him crayons and construction paper.   At best they deserve a half a star.. but since I can't do that, Jack's gets 1 for just existing.",1.0,2011-07-18,0.374,0.437,0.189,788

709,Ly T.,"Went to a casual dinner here with a group of friends and the wait wasn't nearly as ridiculous as BJs, a big plus. It's not as big as it looks like from the outside, but at least you didn't feel like you needed hawk eye vision to nab a table w/o putting down your name!

There's a bar which you can actually get drinks and chill at, while waiting for your table, again, better than BJ's. Location is good, esp with the lack of eateries near the mall. Nice that they have a parking lot as well.

The chili mac and cheese was great! Lotsa flavor, creamy and not chunky. The pot roast looked a little sad and was nothing special, my friend didn't enjoy it and wouldn't recommend it. Pork chop was good, not dry but not super moist either. The corn hash that came with it was off the hook! Lamb chops also good. 

Portions were good-sized and I liked that their entrees varied in price range depending on what you felt like spending. They had plenty of items on their menu, will definitely come back again!",4.0,2011-08-15,0.076,0.237,0.687,189
710,Good D.,"3 1/2 stars

Table had crumbs still on it. Could have done a better job clearing the table. 

Appetizer - BBQ Wings were deep fried and slathered in BBQ sauce. A little spicy kick to the sauce which made it very flavorful. Chicken was moist but nothing special. It was the sauce that made it good!

Dinner - Sunset Boulevard burger was yummy!  Medium rare and loads of avocado, thick slices of bacon and cheese melted just right. 

Tutto Mare had a lot of noodles and good amount of seafood.  Taste was good.

Pot roast was moist but not what I expected. It came out on a large platter with a ton of mashed potatoes and plenty of fresh veggies. Too bad the meat was the smallest portion. 

Our waitress was attentive and kind. 

The atmosphere was part families, part single couples and small groups.  Like another person said,  it wasn't really one kind of style or the other.  

Would go back to try the Mac n cheese.",3.0,2012-10-18,0.297,0.354,0.349,168
711,Simon L.,"SELECTION - typical American fare with a poor effort of Greek inspiration. Expect to pay $15-20 for entrees and $7-10 for appetizers. 

WHY COME? - San Bruno lacks good food...this is a *good* alternative to mall food or BJ's

WHY AVOID? - low quality ingredients

POSITIVES - great decor (despite feeling casino-ish) and friendly service...

THIS IS THE PERFECT PLACE FOR...an alcoholic beverage + appetizers

THIS IS THE WORST PLACE FOR...someone expecting high quality ingredients at an affordable price. 

THE PERFECT MEAL HERE WOULD INCLUDE....an ice cold beverage, sweet potato fries, and spicy barbeque wings.

I WOULD NOT...order the new york steak or fruitti de mare (seafood pasta)...despite the steak being cooked a perfect medium rare, the meat was tough and dry (signs of a low quality cut of meat)...and the pasta had nothing but small pieces of assorted seafood that tasted anything but fresh.

WORD OF ADVICE...avoid any items that require high quality ingredients...my taste buds assume that every ingredient in this place comes frozen or packed in a can...nothing fresh
 
DON'T FORGET...to come early...despite mediocre food, this place always has a line...(reservations NOT accepted)

IF YOU WANTED TO SAVE $$$...only order food from the appetizer menu. 

IN A NUTSHELL....this place has a terrific staff...friendly customer service, clean dining room, and skilled line cooks. Food is prepared perfectly yet the ingredients do not shine. In my opinion, this restaurant sucks because the owners are too cheap to buy fresh, quality ingredients for the staff to work with. Very disappointing considering the heartfelt story written on the back cover of every menu.

ANTHONY BOURDAIN WOULD SAY...""what the *#%! I pay good money and i get this #$%!& ?? Perfect example of money hungry owners buying cheapass ingredients that tastes like @*$%!""",2.0,2011-07-08,0.085,0.129,0.786,291
712,Kim L.,"Happy Hour 330pm to 630pm
Food is so yummy here they have about 6-7 appetizers that are only $5 for happy hour and draft beer and a few cocktails for $4 its quite a deal. The Mediterranean sampler is so delish and so is the calamari!  Sangria was pretty good too. But a must have on their dinner menu is the double pork chops ($18.95)  OMG that was so good i would go back just for that! 
Now as for service i knocked off a star because although we sat at the bar..we were there around 5 and there wasnt many customers around so when our waitress who i over heard was from the san mateo location because she kept saying that didnt come check on us much and when i asked for things she kept forgetting to bring it. The worst was when we asked for more drinks she completely forgot all about us and then decided to hang out at the bar with some fellow employees and started eating olives from the little bin they keep their limes and lemons for drink decorations. Another guy waiter stepped in afterwards because we kept asking him for things instead..
Needless to say keep your san mateo employees in san mateo...

Jack's though is smaller in restaurant space, so there's a pretty good chance you'll have to wait for a table, and since it's at a very small strip mall, there's little parking (my advice - don't be a lazy ass; park by the bank and just walk). the staff is friendly, the wait for food took longer than Boulevard, and it's pretty much the same exact menu too. so basically if you live, work or close by and don't want to drive all the way to Daly City, go to Jack's. it's really that plain and simple.",3.0,2012-02-23,0.199,0.226,0.575,114

721,Christine M.,"Went here last nite for my weekly date with my son. We just came from running Crystal Springs Reservoir and feeling a lil famished.  So my 4 stars are for the dessert and the dessert chef.  

Dinner:
Meatloaf w/ Mashed potatos:$11.95 My son ordered this and I basicly was tortured watching him enjoy his meal. But I did take a bite of it.  The meatloaf was good but on the salty side...not sure if it was the gravy or the meatloaf. But i did enjoy the tomato based mushroom sauce. Loved the onion rings ontop.

Asian chicken salad- $ 8.95 I liked the dressing but since they pre toss the salad in it by the time i got thru half of it...my salad started to wilt. So maybe I would order it next time with dressing on the side.  First time I had a salad that actually had more chicken than salad.  My salad was completely covered in almonds....good thing I like almonds gave the salad a nice crunch besides the fried wontons..wish they had carrots in it or at least red cabbage cuz it was basicly all chopped lettuce covered in almonds and chicken.

Dessert: The pumpkin bread pudding- I love the fact the dessert chef comes out to bring it. But he was so kind enough to stop and suggest items he likes...better he actually asked what I was into and really listened so he can suggest a dessert to my needs.  I wish I had caught his name so I can thank him.  I would go back just for desserts. The way he described all of them...he really made it hard to decide what to pick. Since I wanted something warm he suggested the pumpkin bread pudding...OMG so good! The top layer is pumpkin bread and then u dig alil deeper and its like custard or some kind of pumpkin puree...I think I found my new favorite dessert!

After I met Bunny, we talked about the possibility of trying out this new place. Being inside the mall, there was plenty of other options, such as the food court, Hooters, BJ's, etc.  We decided on Jack's and headed over there.

It was a rainy day but despite the weather, the parking lot was full and there were many customers inside. However since it was a pretty big plaza, we didn't have too much trouble finding a space. Upon entering, I felt like I was on vacation at a lobby of a hotel.  We were greeted and able to be seated right away. As we glanced over the menu, we were glad to know that breakfast was served until 2PM.

The service was good and the staff was friendly. I went with Two Eggs, any style, which came with hashbrowns and taste. Bunny got the Country Fried Steak and eggs. Our food came right away and the server would come by often to check up on us. Everything was delicious and we enjoyed our breakfast. The eggs were fresh and the hash browns were great.

-Pumpkin bread pudding: not worth it. It's only good the first couple of bites. It's not really a traditional bread pudding though-it's very mushy in the center.
-my friend had a pasta dish and said it was good but the noodles were a little too hard

2nd visit
-half chicken with fingerling potatoes and sauteed garlic spinach(excellent dish)
-spicy buffalo wings-really good also. they know they chicken b/c it was nice & juicy. skin was perfectly crisp and fried with the sauce not making it soggy. it wasnt spicy at all though.

744,Stephanie M.,"Because we have a Jack's by our house (Pleasant hill) and we love it, we thought lets give this one a try.

Let me start by saying our waitress was really nice.  Both my husband and grandmother had corned beef hash, they loved it.  My breakfast on the other hand was very bland (Elena's), my hash browns where raw and my toast wasn't toasted.  I think I could have over looked all that until I asked to order something to go for my daughter.  We arrived at 9:00 and I wanted to order macaroni and cheese to go.  The waitress explained that they don't serve pasta until 10:00, no problem I will place the order right before we leave.  At about 9:40 the manager or owners wife came in and had spaghetti (which looked delicious), great I figure now its OK for me to place my order.  Well was I wrong, at 10:10 when I tried to place my order I was told ""We don't serve pasta at this time"".  Obviously, what was I thinking.

I guess I have always believed in business don't do something for a friend or family you wouldn't do for everyone.  After all everyone IS your business",3.0,2011-11-07,0.367,0.466,0.166,202
745,Michael Q.,"I came here with my family and my sister's boyfriend. She and her boyfriend went the day before and wanted us to try it.

We first got there and they said the wait was about 30 minutes. We were seated after about 15 minutes (I like when restaurants give me a longer waiting period but seat us quicker than they say). 

When we were seated, my sister's boyfriend didn't have a place setting. We asked the waitress and she kind of took awhile to bring it. We ordered the garlic & oregano fries and calamari for the appetizers. Overall, it was pretty good and also light. The bread was pretty good too and it wasn't hard.

I had the Italian pasta and I have to say it was pretty tasty.

My only negative would be the waitress was kind of forgetful at times. However, she was very nice and would check back up once in awhile.

At the end of the day, I would come back here. The prices were pretty fair. 

Oh, and the sangria was pretty good too, haha. It said on the menu ""it will change your life"". I don't know if it's THAT good, but it was fine.",4.0,2011-08-07,0.199,0.382,0.42,202
746,Valerie E.,"Ever watched Restaurant Wars/Restaurant Battle? This kind of reminds me of that. It's a very open and clean space, servers are very nice, and helpful and the food is good. They have booths and tables--the tables are a little close. But we did have a nice conversation with a couple sitting next to us. 

They have a back area which I think is used for bigger parties. They put a bunch of tables together and had a long banquet on another night that I was there. It was pretty packed and loud on a Monday night! Probably because they're new. The first time I tried to go, I left because the wait was 45 mins for lunch! 

Food is good! Their pot roast is very tender. Mashed potatoes are very flavorful. Salmon is also good. Pumpkin bread pudding is delish! Lots of things to try on the menu!

And it took FOREVER to order more food or another round of drinks. Our waiter was nowhere to be seen. We had to order from someone else. Very frustrating. 

On to the food which was disappointing! We ordered mainly from the HH menu:

Classic buff wings - it was ok, nothing special
Calamari - not crispy enough but the dipping sauces were good
Flatbread pizza - too plain 
Garlic fries- pretty good
Mac n cheese with bacon - nasty, way too Salty! U would think it should be pretty damn good since they offer quite a few diff types of mac n cheese. But wrong!

748,Mariela D.,"A new sports bar in the 650! I had been watching and patiently waiting for the opening of Jack's. I frequent the 650 alot and I feel like I'm always going to the same old places. So I was happy to have a new option.

At 9:30pm Saturday night, it was a full house but luckily there was no wait. The crowd was mostly young couples and small groups of 20- and 30-somethings. The ambiance was lively, bordering on loud. But it's a sportsbar, so that is to be expected.

Their menu is extensive, but thankfully it doesn't cross over with BJ's Brewery across the street, so I have a reason to come here. They have pastas, burgers, different types of mac n cheese, salads, and an admirable dessert menu. They also have a full bar.

I was SO tempted to order something greasy, but I went with a shrimp louie which was actally not that much of a compromise since I love Louie salads. My louie was delicious and generously portioned, although I was sad to see it was missing the olives it was supposed to have ((sad face)). My husband's italian pasta with sausage and peppers was oily, buttery goodness. I had one forkful and had to stop myself from inhaling the rest.

Everything was great. The only part that annoyed me is when the waitress brought back change in $5's because it made tipping her difficult. Service was a bit slow, too. But it's a new place so I'm sure they're still getting adjusted.

So I am writing a long overdue revised review. Jack's got their act together and is now our favorite place to go for a meal in San Bruno. We go here often. Service is really good but tonight was a special treat. There has been no problems with the servers over the past 2 years. But tonight we had the extreme pleasure of being served by Aaron. Where to begin? Aaron was a delight! He has a joyful spirit that radiated from him. He was attentive, but not intrusive despite being very busy and multitasking like crazy. If I had my own business,  I'd steal him away.

750,Rochelle D.,"I've eaten at Jack's on a couple of occasions, once for Brunch and once for Dinner.  Each time we dined here, the wait time was no longer than about 10 minutes.

The portion sizes here are ginormous.

For brunch, I ordered the Greek yogurt, which was blanketed in sliced almonds and fruit.  I should have told the server I was allergic to cantaloupe.  I'm really not, I just don't like it.  After skimming off all the extras, I found the yogurt and happily drizzled honey over it and was a happy caper.  But be forewarned, they'll serve you like almost a full 12 oz container of the stuff.  I was hoping that they had a cup size, instead of a bowl. 

For dinner, i tried their Turkey Meatloaf.  I even asked for no gravy.  The server pulled the eyebrow with the, ""Are you sure?"" tone.  So I took it on the side.

Me & my guy came here for dinner last night at around 8:30.  There was one couple already sitting in the front area.  We are given one of those buzzing things.  A couple minutes pass & a guy & 3 girls come in & it's apparent the guy works here.  They are seated IMMEDIATELY, which I'm sorry is BULLSHIT.  There are 2 tables open still at this point.  The other couple ahead of us gets seated & then a couple minutes later, we are seated.  I was not that hungry so I only got a cesar salad, the WORST salad I have ever had.  How do you fuck up a salad?  It was sour tasting & the croutons were overpoweringly garlic.  Our waters were NEVER refilled & our waitress NEVER came to check on us.

763,Jenn D.,"A must NOT try.

I honestly don't  care if Jack's had JUST opened and are still working out their ""kinks"" in the business, the restaurant and staff were downright unprepared, lacked training, and completely clueless.

You walk in and go ahead and give them the number of party members and your name; so far, normal. Then they give you a wait estimate (20 minutes wait for an uncrowded Sunday night for two). Believe me, the hostesses have no idea what they're doing and the manager on shift was not doing much of a better job. There were clearly open tables, but we had to wait roughly 25 minutes for a table that was right beneath our noses the ENTIRE time. They don't even try to hide their open tables near the back, they're wide in the open, towards the front.

The menu: nothing special; typical items that you can order at other Traditional American restaurants. The prices are roughly then same too, if not higher. So we waited about 40 minutes for our food to come out, which was a salad and a burger - which I would assume shouldn't even take half as long to make. They also messed up on the orders and didn't even apologize.

I've gone to Hooters across the street, 2 weeks before they had even open for their trial run-throughs and they were a ton more prepared and friendlier in service.

764,Chad B.,"First off, this is the sister restaurant of Boulevard Cafe in Daly City. So out of curiosity, we went here with a good friend over the weekend to simply try it out.

I love our Boulevard Cafe where we live but I must say that we were equally impressed with Jack's. Their menu mirrors that of Boulevard Cafe with some minor changes like mashed potatoes that comes with their pot roast versus orzo pasta. 

But the one thing that stood out for me is how different their cocktail menu is compared Boulevard. I like what Boulevard Cafe has in terms of their cocktail menu but Jack's does offer up a different variety, which makes the trip down there well worth it.

As usual, service is fantastic. John has been a mainstay at Boulevard Cafe but has since moved to Jack's and has remained cordial and friendly to all his customers.

Jack's is a family restaurant and its comfort food that caters to all kinds of palate out there. It's difficult to choose from but my faves are the pot roast, salmon in orza pasta, their mac-n-cheese menu and of course their burgers. I also love their calamari plate and not to forget their polenta appetizer. Also, come here for brunch and you won't be disappointed.

The only thing that can be a challenge is parking. we discovered that their parking lot is not the biggest but there is street parking which is not a far walk to the restaurant. Lastly, I also learned that they do not take reservations. So note to self.

770,Cassie H.,"I live in the apartment complex across from Jack's and have been excited for its grand opening (finally something other than Chili's or BJ's!). I had the opportunity to eat here this past Saturday with my fiance and my parents. Here are my thoughts:

The Ambience- It's lacking. I kind of felt like I was at a Fresh Choice with a bar; it had a cafeteria-like atmosphere. However, the bar was decent and the bartender very attentive and kind. Not to mention, I can care less about the look and feel of the place if my food tastes good with service to match.

The Service- It was about 12:45 pm and the restaurant was a little more than half full. Our server was a bit junior and was unable to answer some of our questions about certain menu items, but he was friendly and accommodating. And not that he necessarily had a hand in this, but our food arrived very quickly, I'd say in less than 10 minutes.

The Food- Surprisingly very tasty. I debated for awhile between the homemade veggie burger and the turkey club, but settled on the turkey club for fear of getting slimy eggplant on the veggie burger. The turkey club was a good choice; fresh carved turkey, crispy bacon, lightly toasted sourdough, fresh produce, and it wasn't saturated in sauce or condiments. I also had the sweet potato fries for my side dish and they were crispy and well seasoned. No complaints here with my meal. We also had a tuna melt, one of their specialty burgers and an eggs benedict at our table, all of which were also eaten with no complaints.

My first impression definitely encourages a return. I'll need one or two more visits before I consider Jack's a safe venture, but this visit has left me very optimistic. =)",4.0,2011-03-07,0.561,0.262,0.177,308

772,Fran N.,"Have you ever been to Chucke E. Cheese? Have you smelled the inside of it? That's EXACTLY what Jack's Restaurant and Bar smells like!! As soon as I walked in, the smell was so overwhelming that I really wanted to leave. Can you say ventilation system? I decided to just stay since we were already there and found parking. I thought that since we were seated in the back of the restaurant that maybe it wouldn't be so hot and that the vents would probably work but to my surprise, it wasn't. It was just as bad as entering the restaurant. 

The decor of the place reminds me of a restaurant inside of a hotel. It was pretty nice but I wasn't all that impressed. The bar area looked really small. To my knowledge, if your going to make a bar area, it should be near the entrance and be the main focus point. I feel like they should have made the the bar area where the kitchen area is and vice versa. You don't want to be bombarded by a bunch of drunks while your eating your meal. Am I right? 

The menu has some pretty good choices. Kind of over priced in my opinion. The specialty drinks are a rip off. If I'm going to pay $9.00 for a frozen blended mojito, I would expect there to be some taste of alcohol. It basically tasted like I was drinking a smoothie. The poor waitress tried her best to take it back to the bar so they can make it stronger but the manager said that they can't do that and that I can buy a shot on the side and pour it into my drink? Uhh.... I don't think so. Who in their right mind would do that? I praise the waitress for trying really hard to make us happy but the manager clearly doesn't know what customer service is. 

I ordered the spaghetti with meatball and flatbread pizza. Both dishes were just mediocre. I know I should have just gotten the tutto mare or the spaghetti with clams. The spaghetti tasted like frozen dinner spaghetti. The meatballs were pretty good and gigantic so that kind of made up for the taste. The flatbread pizza was just so-so. The avgolemono soup was delicious tho. Not too sour and the chicken was so tender.  My cousin ordered the sweet potato fries which didn't appeal to me. I think the ones at Big Mouth Burger were way better.

You can definitely tell they have some kinks in this restaurant that need to be straightened out. I feel like they rushed to open this place and weren't prepared for the outcome. Our waitress was really sweet and nice and checked up on us during our meal. It was obvious that she was new to the waitressing scene but she put a lot of effort into making sure we got excellent customer service. 

Customer service was great. Just because of my waitress in general but most likely I won't be coming back for the food or drinks.",3.0,2011-03-12,0.111,0.477,0.412,515

Food was quite good.

The restaurant interior is a little bland looking - hope they add a little pizazz to the place. It was also COLD  both times I was there.

Service definitely needs a bit of a step up - first time I was there the wait was LONG for dinner to arrive. Second time was during lunch and waiter screwed up my order. It was quickly fixed however. Hopefully they'll get into the groove the longer they are open. Dropped 1/2 star for that.

775,Amy B.,"Have I mentioned that I wish yelp did half stars? I'll round up here, because Jack's impressed me more than I thought it would. We stopped here while in the area for something else and were too tired and hungry to make it down to one of our favorite Filipino places on El Camino Real. It first struck me as a wanna be chain type of place, that is to say a place that probably had decent burgers but where I wouldn't trust getting any other kind of food. I don't know if those instincts are correct, but the burger was surprisingly good! 

In full disclosure, I have been cutting back on eating meat lately and hadn't had a burger in a very long time. I felt OK having one here since they ground their own fresh chuck daily (according to their menu, at least). I ordered the Sunset Blvd burger with sweet potato fries. The burger was delish, and so huge that I could only eat half. And the sweet potato fries were perfectly crispy without being greasy. I dare say some of the better sweet potato fries I've had.

I was also super-duper excited to see pumpkin bread pudding on the menu. I love me some pumpkin, and never, ever turn down bread pudding when I see it on a menu. But I'm sorry to say that I was deeply disappointed with the dish. First, it was old and reheated, and was cold in some places and scalding hot in others. It also wasn't so much of a bread pudding as it was a custardy something with a bit of bread pudding on top. 

I should add that I really debated between getting a burger and getting on of the several mac & cheese dishes they have. I very rarely pass up mac & cheese, and their selection is impressive. If I find myself there again, I may try one. 

Overall, not bad. Especially considering the chain alternatives in the immediate vicinity.",4.0,2011-06-18,0.119,0.329,0.551,334

I settled for the chili soup and the Jack's burger.  I was really disappointed.  Chili was nothing exciting and I love Chili.  It would have been perfect for this cold, rainy, windy day.  

Have you heard of the line, ""the burger can stand on it's own?"".  Not this one.  They left the beef unseasoned.  Waitress told us it's 100% angus beef and grounded in-house.  So what?  It wasn't even close to fantastic.

778,Qiana T.,"If this was based off food alone Jack's would have 5 stars from me! Evereything we've tried on the menu is delicious. Clean, modern decor, mixed crowed. This is the type of place you can eat a lil something at the bar while watching the game, dine with your family, or take a date here. Its not very big inside, but they work the space well. 

They get 3 stars from me because of their service.. is not in line with the environment the place creates. The wait staff I've encountered seem inexperienced. We had a question about that days special and the server just said "" I have no idea. Can I get you something to drink? "" Not ""let me find out for you"" or ""I'm not sure, let me ask someone"" and how you just going to respond that way like it's going to suffice?? So of course, we gave him the stank eye and asked him to find out. wtf! 

After we ate our appetizers it took almost 50minutes for our entrees to come out. =/ Our server didn't acknowledge the long wait, as he was walking by he said ""the pork chop you ordered takes a little longer"" as he was still walking! like stopping to say so was unheard of and waiting damn near an hour was the norm. Not to mention.. I was at the table with a fine dining manager and a restaurant owner. We all knew the real deal. Either your dumb ass forgot to place the order or someone dropped my meat on the floor and had to make it again! 

My gf ordered the thai steak salad... why was the steak bloody. Who is plating the dish and sees bloody pieces of meat on a SALAD and says to themselves ""yup, this looks good to go!"" ?? So of course we asked for the meat to be cooked more. Ok so you're reading this probably thinking like I am.. just cook the meat till its well done, toss another salad and BAM! There's your thai steak salad, redone and perfected! NOPE this took 20min. for a salad with some strips of meat. strips of meat that you already cooked, but you cooked it a half past rare. THIN strips of meat might I add. 

So we call over the manager after we finish our meal. The manager that should have came to the table when we sent food back. Supposedly he was unaware of it because he had the bartender serving our area and he was out of his element. =/ whatever. He listened to our complaints and addressed it with, next time you're here ask for me and I'll buy you a round of drinks. OK 1.) none of us were drinking in the first place and NO buying me an ice tea won't cut it. 2.) you never told us your name! 3.) if you're going to comp someone.. do it now. 

We got our appetizer free and my ice tea was on the house. Gee thanks. 

In time I would hope the service improves to meet the standard that they appear to be striving for, but for right now the service is really driving down the place for me. 

The food though.. when cooked fully lol.. is delicious! I recommend the fried chicken.",3.0,2011-05-17,0.268,0.384,0.348,557

783,Heather H.,"Tried Jack's for the first time this afternoon. It was pretty good. I live in the apartments next door so it was a short walk. Service was great, only problem was there was wayyy to many employees there. Alot of them were just standing around but with it being the first Saturday open I can imagine they needed a few people on standby in case of a mad rush of people.

On to the food, I had the Pot Roast with mashed potatoes and vegetables. The pot roast was ok, it could have been more tender but it was tolerable. Mashed potatoes were instant (go figure) but still good. My boyfriend had the meatloaf (he has to try it at every restaurant since it's his favorite, lol) and he said ""Not that great, must be a California thing"". We are from the Midwest and alot of the food is different out here so we haven't quite adapted to the CA food tastes yet, lol. 

I had the Carmelized Banana Split for dessert, vanilla bean ice cream with carmelized bananas with whipped cream and a cherry with some chocolate and caramel on top. It was absolutely delicious!!! I would definitely have that every time I go eat there. My boyfriend had the Chocolate Tuxedo Cake, 6 layers of chocolately yummy goodness!

784,Michele P.,"Went here the other night with my boyfriend and another couple.  We actually decided to go to Jack's because it was close by and had tv's so we could watch the Giants game.   The menu is pretty simple in terms of American food.  You got your pastas, macaroni and cheese selections, hamburgers, salads and comfort foods.  

I was starving so I went for a hearty meal of pot roast with mashed potatoes and veggies.  It was delicious.  The meat and tender and the veggies were cooked well.  Plus, the portions are generous so I was more than full when finished!  Looking around at other people's dishes, everything looked scrumptious.   I usually don't have a too high standard for standard American food, but I gotta say that Jack's does it right.  

The place was pretty packed (we were there on a Thursday night), but the waiting time wasn't bad at all.  We probably waited for about 15 minutes or so before being seated.  

Prices are moderate, depending on what you order.  I believe my dish was around the $13 or so dollar range.  Seems about right and I think it's worth it.   They give you sliced sourdough bread and butter before the meal as well, but try not to eat too much! Your entree will fill you up.",4.0,2011-07-16,0.54,0.35,0.11,217

This girl served our table and wowza.. her voice was really gentle and sweet. i never heard of this place until i finally went here with my sister  and her boss. the setting was lovely. it almost felt like a five star restaurant. I recommend going in the evening.it gives you the romantic tone especially with their lighting toned down. but sadly, i  was with my sister at the time. ha 

i think it really depends on what food you order. some foods, usually dinner time, are pretty oily. it's too bad that they don't serve breakfast and lunch meals in the evening.  but if you're there for breakfast, try the greek scramble breakfast. i forgot the name of it, but it was scrambled eggs with lamb meat, red and green bell pepper with the side of hashbrown and three toasted bread. it was so appetizing that i wanted to take my time to cherish each bite. IT WAS DELICIOUS!!!!! their shrimp scampi and fries are delicious as well. most of their are served in large portions with a reasonable price!

787,Cecile R.,"It is refreshing to see a non-chain restaurant open in the area. My friend said parking was limited. We were meeting early (5ish) so not a problem but I can see parking limited.

Was I visiting a doctor's office? The entry to the restaurant is not a selling point.

We were greeted by the hostess but headed straight to the bar.

Bartender greeted me instantly and served me my coctail immediately.

If you don't know there are Happy Hour specials, the bartender didn't offer up. $4 on selected beers/wines; $5 selected specialty cocktails; $5 selected appetizers. I'm not sure if the portion size differs from what is on the Starters  on the menu.

The meditteranean plate was appealing:hummus, tabouli, tzatziki, olives and warm, grilled pita slices; flat bread pizza was enjoyable:feta, kalamata slices, carmelized onions, and asiago.

As it got busier the bartender needed to be flagged.

Sous chef JB was delivering desert of brulee at the bar and stopped by to check how things were.

jack's is definitely a 5 star San Bruno restaurant, but that's not saying much.  working in south SF is awful, b/c of the lack of food choices.  for work lunches we usually choose between elephant bar, chili's and bj's, so i was super excited to see this new thing called ""Jack's"" across from the tanforan mall.  then i was super super excited when i saw on-line that they have a whole section dedicated to mac & cheese.

wait - never had to wait more than 5 minutes

decor - nice & clean with big booths for our usual group of 5 or 6

service - pretty fast, which is bad if you don't want to go back to work.

790,Al L.,"Second visit to Jack's was a little less satisfying.   Our friend ordered the Salisbury steak Early Bird special-it had to be returned to the kitchen because it was extremely rare.  When the plate returned, it was still rare-not enough time on the grill.  The fried chicken, spaghetti and clams, and grilled salmon entrees ordered by the rest of the party were very good. 

The place was packed and the noise was deafening.  Perhaps glass partitions could be installed on the booths closest to the bar in order to cut down the noise level and to give those seated diners a little peace of mind from the Happy Hour crowd who were sometimes 2 or 3 people deep at the bar.  

I do have to say that the food was still tasty and service was fairly attentive despite the crowds.  I had that pumpkin bread pudding last night and it's not what you expect-very light and creamy instead.",4.0,2011-03-05,0.172,0.31,0.518,157

Its a very nice simple and sophisticated place with photos of their restaurant family hanging.  

The bar is smallish but I would guess they prefer to keep the drinking crowd out and use the bar more for waiting custumers than people coming just to drink.

794,Rachel C.,"Went here tonight with the family.  Nice to see a non-chain restaurant open up.  They actually have one in Pleasant Hill and are also apparently associated with Boulevard Cafe in Daly City.

Place was already pretty fulll and it wasn't even 5:30 yet, but we managed to get the last table...right near the door.  Did not like it there at all as there was no barrier between you and the people coming in to wait.  I don';t enjoy eating with everyone facing me and watching!!

We started with sweet potato fries.  They were good, nice combo of crunchy and soft.  Husband ordered the CHicken Asiago, daughter had the fried chicken early bird special (13.95..plus you get soup or salad and they have a great selection early bird specials).  I took a risk and ordered the lamb chops and my son, well, he had the chcicken fingers and fries..as usual, lol.

Good portions of food, all the chicken dishes were cooked nicely.  Daughter's fried chicken had a nice crust on it (3 pieces!).  Her mashed potatoes were pretty anemic in the flavor department and the veggies served with it, quite unexciting.  I asked for my lamb chops mid rare..what I got was far south of that....not a drop of pink.  I didn't send them back because they were not too tough but I wasn't that happy with them.  Served with a nice bunch of sauteed spinach and feta-garlic potato wedges.  They were delicious.

Ordered dessert since we have never been here...pumpkin bread pudding, a carmelized banana split, and an apple pie a la mode.  The bread pudding was very light and tasty, the banana split was ok, but they used all vanilla ice cream and there didn't seem to be much sauce of any kind and the weirdest thing of all..the apple pie looked and tasted EXACTLY like the one from Costco.  Don't get me wrong, I love Costco'd apple pie, but this place supposedly has a pastry chef??  Hmmmm...

Service was..ok.  When it was time for dessert, one of the 3 ladies working the hostess stand kind of tossed us a dessert menu.  One.  For four people.  Also, the waiter packaged out leftovers really weirdly!  He had a separate container for each item that was all on my plate, and then he had one big container into which he dumped my daughters chicken leftover, my sons, and my potato wedges.  Why???  EVen better, my one little container holding my 2 leftover lamb chops opened up and fell onto the ground.

802,Freckles H.,"Being a neighbor to Jack's, I've been here 4 times. I came for dinner, once for happy hour, and twice time for brunch/lunch. Brunch was very unimpressive (still a Stack's fan). I ordered eggs, ham, hash brown plate and nothing on there was good. However, their bellini was pretty good. The puree just sat at the bottom of the glass and wasn't mixed in, which was weird. The second time was really good since I ordered off their lunch menu instead. The Pomegranate in a Pear Tree (beverage), spinach salad, rigatoni, fries (reg & cheese), Cali. mac n cheese/bacon mac n cheese, espresso milkshake, and tutto mare were all very good. I didn't have this all in one sitting, but was divided over 2 visits. Not so good was the calamari and sweet potato fries. Their wings are average. Nothing spectacular.

As for happy hour, their specials are ok. It's $5 for finger foods and $5 cocktails, although it was only a selection of 4 items. It's definitely not a place to root for the home team though. BJs/Elephant Bar would be a much better place for that type of event.

805,Linda N.,"My boyfriend and I recently had dinner at this restaurant. We ordered the lemon butter petrale sole to share. It was the perfect portion for both of us to be semi-full and still have room for dessert. The fish was quite tasty, there was a bit of crispyness to the fish underneath a delicious buttery sauce. It was so good, but there was a strange texture to the fish, like fish scales that I couldn't quite put my finger on..I think perhaps I was eating too fast and not chewing enough lol. 

We finished off with the Black Tuxedo Cake for dessert. Kudos to the pastry chef for this chocolatey wonder! I definitely recommend this cake to all my fellow Yelpers. The frosting, whatever it was, was so smooth and creamy. The cake was just the right amount of sweetness and so moist. It definitely didn't taste like its been sitting in the fridge for a while like at those other chain restaurants. So fresh! I loved it.

I agree with what other people say about Jack's. It definitely needs to work on decor. The waiting room was so plain, needs a painting or two. The walls of this restaurant too. It was just so plain!

806,Jeff S.,"Go once for the experience and decide if the ambiance and menu works for you.... 

We decided to try Jacks since it is right across the road as we exit 380. The parking lot was busy but we found a spot - so parking could be a problem on 'extremely' busy nights. The wait was 35 minutes and we decided to wait it out so we could see what the place was like; I don't think we actually waited the full 35 minutes. We got a place by the window which was nice. For me, the ambiance is a little lacking (large screen monitors in all the rooms), but it is probably exactly the atmosphere they were hoping to create. The menu is pretty extensive; some dishes seemed a bit pricey for the type of place it is but the majority of menu items seemed to be priced reasonably. I ordered the New York steak and the waitress helped me make some substitutions (I really hate cooked spinach!). We ordered wine and they brought us bread. 

There was nothing extraordinary about the food. My meal was okay - the meat was a terrible cut (who was doing THAT butchering?) and I cut off some connective fat that told me it wasn't a fine cut of meat. On the other hand, the vegetables and the crispy french fries were just fine. I must say that the vegetables (steamed mixed broccoli, cauliflower, squash) were cooked perfectly - not overcooked and mushy with a bit of bite still in them. My husband's spaghetti carbonara didn't look that great - he didn't finish it but didn't complain. The bits of pancetta looked almost like pepper flakes. 

The waitress was nice and attentive so there was nothing wrong with our service. She came back several times to check on us and that was appreciated.

Would I wait 35 minutes again? Probably not. Since they don't take reservations, I probably won't be going back unless I know that they aren't that busy.",3.0,2011-07-16,0.38,0.336,0.284,336

I got a grilled chicken sandwich which was decent. The chicken wasnt dry, and the pesto mayo added flavor. 

The avgolemono soup is good if you dont mind a strong lemon flavor, but be warned the serving is pretty tiny. However the chicken in there is very tender. Its almost like a lemony chicken and rice soup. 

I tried the pumpkin bread pudding cause of all you yelpers, and was disappointed! It was so mushy, and had raiiissssins.. The flavor was alright because I thought it tasted like pumpkin pie (which I love) but I would not recommend this, nor would I order it again.

810,Annie C.,"Saw my friend's doggy bag from this place and was tempted to give this place a go.


Came here Friday night for dinner and it was pretty packed so we waited for about 30 minutes which I didn't really mind since it was dinner on a Friday night, what do you expect right?


There were two hostesses and another guy who I assume is the manager since he was running around letting them know when there were tables available.  The hostesses didn't even greet us and didn't seem too friendly towards us or the other guests, just one of those dead ""Hi..."" SO, the guy who was already running around ended up being the one to get our name down for the waiting list while the girls starred blankly at us on the side.  No bueno.


After getting seated, I looked at what my friend got in his doggy bag last time and it was the Italian Pasta; ordered that while he had the Chicken Piccata.  We also ordered a side of their sweet potato fries which seemed to be a favorite amongst yelpers.  Once again, you guys yet to fail me because they were DELISH!  They sprinkle a little bit of chives on top and it just had that ""Mm, these are hella good"" taste.  My pasta was pretty good but definitely not as good as when you free load off someone else's and his Chicken Piccata wasn't what he thought it was.  (He wanted another dish that his friend had ordered) But it turned out to be pretty good - grilled chicken with a creamy sauce and peas on top, small serving of veggies on the side along with some mashed potatoes (loved) - but, and I quote ""Eh, It's pretty good, but I wouldn't order it again.""



Attire seemed to be anywhere from basketball shorts + white tee to folks that looked like they just got off work with their little ties on.  



When it came time to pay for the bill, I asked to get my food in a box since I had enough to get a doggy bag myself.  But instead, I got JUST the bag, so I asked again and they came back with a BIG box *looks down at pasta* I don't think I have THAT much food left now. So they went back another time to get me a smaller one and I was a little confused seeing that when everyone else asked to get their stuff boxed, the waitors did it for them but they just left me to do it myself. Not too big of a deal but just gave me the ""Oh, I thought they do it for you"" thought. 


Overall I enjoyed the place and will probably be back again and most definitely will be stopping by for some sweet potato fries during happy hour, TO GO.",3.0,2011-04-30,0.445,0.408,0.146,479
811,M G.,"A nice find in San Bruno! I've driven by this place for a while now, but never ventured in. Finally decided to give it a try for lunch today and was happily surprised.

We ate at the bar to avoid the wait for a table.  The coconut shrimp (served with a huge mound of cole slaw) was perfectly crisp, not greasy.  I ordered the thai steak salad, which I didn't anticipate being so close to the cole slaw in color and taste (couldn't really taste the cilantro/basil).  It wasn't bad, but I'd probably try something else next time.  My sister had the tuscan sandwich (eggplant, peppers, mozzarella cheese and pesto) - it was delicious.  The coffee was pretty good too and service was exemplary - food arrived pretty quickly (generous portions) and we were regularly checked on.

As others have mentioned, parking can be scarce when it's busy - the lot is very small, so plan accordingly!

Lastly, when we looked at the restaurant's website, we were excited to see an outdoor patio. However, that's at their Pleasant Hill location, not San Bruno.  Breakfast is also served until 2pm.",4.0,2011-06-24,0.388,0.28,0.333,189

The wait-staff is highly efficient, very friendly and the service is excellent as a result. Whether you want mac-n-cheese with bacon (my personal favorite) or a healthier option of a salad or hummus and such, it's all good. They have a decent beer selection, full bar, and the quality is consistent. The only issue is word has gotten out and it is, understandably, very busy ... but I think worth the wait.",5.0,2014-09-22,0.389,0.341,0.27,101

When we walked in we gave the hostess our name and party # and then took a seat. (It was about 20 minutes for 2 people on a weeknight) I saw that there were opened tables for two but I didn't question them because I didn't want to be THAT person. Anyways, about 20 minutes went by and another couple came in and the dumb blonde said to the hostess ""I need one of those tables for two"" expecting to just get one handed to her. Then the hostess told her it was a 20 minute wait and of course the bi*ch asked why. She then told the hostess they'd wait at the bar. About 10 minutes later I stood up to see if the blonde was at the bar and of course they took one of the tables. I WAS SO PISSED. So once again instead of being THAT person, I just told my boyfriend that they were seated and the hostess happened to over hear me.

Just like that, I got seated. 

Other than the dumb blonde and idiot hostesses, our waiter was amazing and everything tasted great! Our food came out in a timely manner and everything. They really just need to get their hostesses figured out.",3.0,2011-03-20,0.316,0.531,0.154,225

Best in the peninsula. They are served in a nice porcelain plate and there is barely any sauce on the plate, but the wings are nice and wet. The price is right and they have good crisp and flavor. Only thing I can say negative is that the kick was not that strong. But still great wings.

The menu has a fairly wide selection, including breakfast items till 2 pm (woohoo!), salad, sandwiches, pasta, and entrees.  I had a greek omelet, which was basically eggs, scrambled with gyro meat and feta cheese (don't knock it....it was actually pretty good).

I will definitely go back at some point.  And when I do, I think I'll sample something from their macaroni and cheese section (they had like 5-6 different items).",3.0,2011-02-25,0.766,0.187,0.047,98
820,Olivia O.,"My friend was craving pasta so the other friend decided to go here and I got whisked there after classes were over.
We got there and were looking at the majority of the patrons wondering if we were under dressed or not, we found out it was the workers that we were looking at so we decided we were fine and went in. The majority of those there at 7 PM Wednesday were elderly or business people. By the time we left at 9 PM the place was emptying out, maybe we're just missing the night crowd?

The food was okay, I ordered the Mediterranean Pasta no chicken, the pasta was cooked very well, however the sauce was quite salty.
Our free bread we got was very hard, we were making idiots of ourselves trying to cut the small loaf without touching it.
Also our waiter was a bit annoying he kept showing up, I guess some people would like it but for us we're college students who just want to eat and chat awhile without being interrupted every 10 minutes or so.
The truth is when I was looking at the menu I really wanted was some Fish and Chips but it was about 13 dollars, so I definitely didn't go for it.
I would probably not go here again since it's far from where I live, and it didn't seem worth the drive.",2.0,2011-05-08,0.075,0.198,0.727,235
821,Jennifer L.,"May look like a typical American restaurant, but the food tastes good!  There is also an early bird special everyday where they have certain dishes for about $13-$15 that includes a beverage and soup or salad.  Great deal to me especially when the food is good! 

I always order the Red Snapper on the early bird menu.  The fish is moist, not dry at all and well-flavored.  Mashed Potatoes are delicious- all that cream and butter, but oh well!

Also tried the Clam Linguine with White Wine Sauce- good for half the dish, but got overwhelming later.  I only got like 8 fresh clams and the rest was canned- fail.  There was also a spritz of lemon juice which was good at first, but got too much later.

Breakfast- hash browns are wonderful! The potato texture is soft while lightly fried and browned-perfect!  Corned Beef Hash tasty as well, though more on the salty side.

823,Brittany P.,"So glad there's a new restaurant in San Bruno! Because of the lack of decent food, this place is pretty much always packed. They're also open for breakfast too, which is a plus. It's pretty much American food, with a little bit of Mediterranean thrown in because I think the owners are Greek.

Pretty much everything I've had here has been good, and my friends and family I've gone with have all liked their food as well. The polenta appetizer is really good, and so are their macs and cheese. I really liked the spanakopita, but I think they might be taking it off, oh well. They have a huge menu. The only thing I didn't like was the waffle. It was supposed to be a Belgium one, but wasn't crispy at all, and tasted just like a weirdly shaped pancake, and not an especially flavorful one at that. 

The service is always really good. They did a good job training their servers. They're always friendly and attentive.

Most of the servers already know my order, the only fluctutation when I come here is the type of wine I order to accompany my meal.

Zucchini cakes - like a crab cake but with zucchini!  Why didn't I think of this?  Jack's should attempt to make a zucchini crab cake!
Thai beef salad - the beef was surprisingly tender.  This isn't a salad that's drenched with dressing - a perfect balance of flavors.
Tutte Mare - a tomato based seafood pasta with generous amounts of seafood.  Usually when I get pastas like this, the fish is dry but this dish had lots of tender red snapper.  Yumz!

835,Viet T.,"Jack's is a GREAT alternative to BJ's and Chili's and a very welcome addition to the neighborhood.  They recently opened so there are still some kinks to work out, but now that they're here, I'm hoping my colleagues never ever feel the need to visit BJ's again.  I've only been here for lunch/happy hour but I'm guessing dinner is not much different. 

Service - very attentive, but it can take a while for the food to come out. I'm hopeful that this will improve over time.

Bar - our bartender seemed a bit inexperienced with the cocktails but was very friendly. Cocktails are pricey for a neighborhood restaurant and happy hour is from 3:30-6:30pm M-F

Food- an extensive menu ( mostly american and italian ) with something for everybody at a reasonable price. Breakfast is served all day and portions are very generous.  I was pleasantly surprised by the food - I expected something more generic but I've really enjoyed everything I've had so far - the crispy buffalo chicken salad, mac n cheese, crispy fried chicken, and my favorite - the orzo salmon.

This is not a destination restaurant, but if you work or live in the area, you'll likely be a regular here. For fun, be sure to check out their ""Make an Impression Special"" or the ""Deluxe Impression Special"" online and order it in advance. I plan to order this for one of my unsuspecting colleagues soon!

836,Granolia G.,"If you like  Boulevard on John Daly Blvd in Daly City, then you will like this place because it's owned by the same owners. It has a similar feel and menu, except that they have their signature Jack's macs which include: the classic Mac-n-Cheese, Bacon Mac, Chili Mac, Hot Dog Mac, California Mac, and their Italian Mac. I haven't tried any of these, but what I can say is that their food is consistent. 

     My favorite dish here is their Angel Hair Pomodoro. Such a simple dish, but I  know if I'm craving this, I know for a fact that this will be good each and every time !!!!!! If you like prawns, add this to it and this is sure to bring you back! Their Calamari is also delicious. Can't come here without ordering this. Another favorite of mine , in my opinion, is by far one of their other signature dishes as well is the Avgolemono, which is a traditional Greek soup with chicken , egg, lemon, and rice. This is perfect on a cold day or if you're sick. Definitely try  this soup when coming to either Jack's or Boulevard. Yummy! 

      This place is a good all round American food place. It has a great selection of starters, burgers and sandwiches, salads, good selection of starters, pastas, chicken, beef, and fish dishes. It has a good standard kids menu as well. Unfortunately, not much of a vegetarian selection, but I'm sure if you ask, then they will try to  accommodate you as best they can. 

     Good service. Good food. Good selection of alcoholic beverages and decent wine. Portions are huge and they are conveniently located right across the street from Tanforan shopping center.

I read the other reviews on Yelp and decided to try it out instead of eating at one of the many other establishments at the nearby mall.

The layout is open and spacious.  I like that they offer booths along the edges and also tall bar tables as options.  We decided to go for a traditional dinner table.  The wait staff was friendly and satisfactory.  Nothing stellar.  I ordered the polenta while my girlfriend ordered the sole fish.  We shared dishes to have a sample of each.  The polenta was crunch on the edges and smothered in cheese and tomato sauce.  It was like a polenta pizza.  I liked it, but it wasn't what I expected.  The vegetable sides were good though.  The fish was battered and squeezed with lemon.  Good serving portions.  Two pieces of fillets -- most places only give you one.  

Add in two cocktails and the bill came out to around $45.  Pretty typical for dinner.  Overall, it was a nice spot and very conveniently located.  They have a shared private lot that can be crowded, but we found a spot.  I will come back again!",4.0,2012-03-24,0.296,0.29,0.414,225

Wedge Salad- Eh, I didn't like the balsamic dressing drizzled over the blue cheese dressing.  Also, I would have liked to have some tomatoes, shredded carrots or some kind of color on the salad.

Mediterranean Platter - Delicious! Tzatziki, hummus, tabouli, olives and  warm pita bread.  This was perfect, all of it.

Fish and chips- This was good but I didn't care for the tartar sauce.  However the fish was very tasty.

Angel Hair Pasta- Nice dish.  There was nothing special about it, not a hard dish to screw up.

843,Jannet H.,"I frequent this restaurant often, especially for breakfast and lunch. I came on a Friday night for dinner and was incredibly dissapointed. I don't think I have been treated so poorly! First, their front desk quoted us 30-40 minutes for a table, which is expected for a Friday night. So we decided to hang at the bar and have a drink. As we walked to the bar, we noticed quite a few empty tables but didn't really think anything of it. A round later, it's been 45 minutes and our buzzer had not buzzed yet. I walk over to the front desk And tell them I've been waiting longer than my quoted time. They look surprised- as if they thought I left- and told me 11 minutes longer. Very patiently, I tell them that's longer than what I was quoted but accept the news and walk back to the bar. The same tables I saw empty on my initial journey to the bar, remained empty. So at this point I am irritated because I surmise I wasn't on their list, especially when I take a look around and see the same people who checked in the same time as me were already seated. ONE HOUR LATER we had still not been seated. We decided to wait at the front desk and miraculously we are seated right away, IN THE EXACT TABLE I SAW VACANT SINCE WE GOT THERE. Feeling slighted and dismissed, we order out food. 30 minutes later out food comes out and it's wrong. How one confuses well done for rare, amazes me.
After we complain to manager for the dissapointment in our experience, Samantha, simply suggests a drink to compensate for the ill treatment and 3 hour wait for our dinner ( table wait plus waiting for the food to come and then the time it took for them to get it right). Disgusted with the service, we decided to leave, out food uneaten and cold at this point. 
It was a waste of time and money. Needless to say, jack lost some good customers Friday, and I'm canceling my banquet holiday office reservation I had made for next month. They don't deserve my time, money, or business, especially when the manager has no intention of making anything right, rather just shut you up with booze.",3.0,2015-11-15,0.012,0.083,0.906,389

It was a big portion and we only waited a few minutes for them to cook our order.

As I looked at other orders around me, they had huge salad portions.  The meatloaf looked and smelled delicious.  My friend said she had the clams and pasta the other time and every time she's been there, she hasn't been disappointed.

  So one time, my date never got a straw for her soda. Not to mention, the waitress never checked up on us.

  And then recently, the place wasn't that busy that we were seated in an area or section of the room in the back with lots of empty tables n chairs, where it felt like the waiter completely forgot about us after giving us our menus (but, the funny thing was people were gradually being seated near us). So point is he gave us way too much time to order. And finally, when we wanted to ask for the check, (which took forever to come), we just asked the bus boy instead.

But as we looked over the menu for what to drink and eat nobody came.  We waited and waited but still no one came, and the place only ha like 5 people eating.  The staff was more concerned about closing, running around an cleaning up the tables and bringing stuff to the back. I decided that if no one came in the next five minutes, we were leaving.  And sure enough, no one came.  So we left, and as we were leaving the hostess asked where we were going, when we told her she was even puzzled.  Oh we'll....",1.0,2012-10-08,0.002,0.01,0.987,133
853,Karen B.,"Came her for a mid-week dinner with the 'rents.  The wait wasn't too long.  Our server was very attentive and responsive.  The food was served faster than I thought.  Literally within less than 10 minutes our meals were served.  

Granted, my mom did order the Greek Salad and I had the Wedge.  Both salads were very good.  The greens were fresh and crisp and the overall flavor was savory.  My dad had the spaghetti and meatballs.  He doesn't share his food, so I'll take his word for it: it was good.  Of course he also cleared his plate, so that's another sign he liked it.

Dessert was somewhat disappointing.  I love me some bread pudding and this one had the potential to be excellent, but it failed.  The top part was nice and toasted, but once digging in, the bread pudding had the consistency of creme brulee.  It was mushy and gelatinous, not bread pudding like at all.

Prices are average.  I think I'll return, but won't order the bread pudding again.",3.0,2011-06-09,0.388,0.295,0.317,172

860,Linda N.,"Came here two times already. First time was for a lunch with work and since i liked it so much, i came back here with the boyfriend the following week. The first time, I had a burger with bacon and a side of sweet potato fries. Very filling and yummy. The burger was cooked just right (medium) and was huge portion. The sweet potato fries was recommended by many reviews and they were right: it was good! Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Very addicting. Once you start, you can't stop! 
The second time, I had the thai salad. It had cabbage, noodles, other stuff and slices of charboiled beef. Once again, the portion was huge! The beef had too strong of a charboiled taste so that was the only downside. We also had onion rings which came with chipotle mayo. SO GOOD! FOr dessert, we had the caramalized banana split ice cream sundae. Delicious! the banana had a crispy caramel layer on top and they gave me an extra scoop of strawberry ice cream! Very delicious!!
Each time i was there, the giants game was on and they have a HUGEEE TV to show it on which is a major PLUS STAR! I would totally come back on a game day to watch the game and eat yummy food.

Gave coffee with no spoon and never asked me for refill. It was not attentive enough. I have to call the manager over to ask for a new lemonade more flavor.

I ordered the southern comfort, which is a chicken fried steak with country gravy served over a Belgian waffle topped with 2 fried eggs. It was very good! The gravy was smooth and creamy and the steak was a very good piece of meat. Very tender and not tough at all. I also had a side of hash brown which are made from Yukon gold potatoes. Fresh and tasty! They also had about 4 different types of Mac n cheese, I love a good Mac n cheese so I had to try it. I had the bacon Mac. It was really good!

893,Pamela V.,"Let me start by saying that I've been a fan and loyal customer of this restaurant since it opened.  While there have been a few bumps in the road, all in all it quickly became one of my favorite spots.  So much so that I am there 4-5 times per week and am recognized by the staff.  Today was enough to stop me from going ever again and for me to tell absolutely everyone I know not to go there.  We were a party of four and had to wait 15 minutes for a table which was perfectly acceptable.  We ordered our drinks and they came quickly.  Unfortunately the coffee was so old that it couldn't be consumed.  The waitress brought a new cup of coffee right away.  My tomato juice was bloody mary mix.  When I informed the waitress of the mix up she came back and said that I was given bloody mary mix because there was no tomato juice opened.  She offered to open one and bring it over which she did.  Because we were so hungry and everything looked good we ordered seven different meals (yes for the four of us).  Two people in our party were served their meals and the other two of us waited.  When my meal (artichoke eggs benedict) came it was missing the artichoke.  I brought it to the attention of the waitress and she took it back to have a new one prepared.  Still only two of us had our meals.  We waited so long for the other ones to arrive that the meals that were delivered to half our party were finished and they were working on their second meals.  I went to the ""manager"" and told him that while I realize that they are busy we waited 10 minutes for half of our party to receive the orders.  He immediately told me that I was not correct in my timing and that the kitchen had dropped a plate of food which caused the delay.  I guess dropping one plate of food meant that two people had to wait for their meals.  I went back to my seat to wait for my food and it finally came.  Sadly when it did, it was COLD.  Now I don't mind eating luke warm food but COLD....uh no.  So I ask to see the manager again and the waitress tells me that he said he was too busy to talk to me.  I went back to the hostess stand to get him to come back but instead he sent another manager over to explain that they had not charged us for any of the meal.  While that was very noble of him, I was not looking for free food.  It is more important to me to be able to enjoy a meal from one of my favorite places then to order a ton of food and expect it for free.  So I wait for the ""manager"" to come back so I can explain that while I know that they are busy I was very disappointed and upset that I was told I was called a liar when I stated the wait time for two of our party to be served.  I was told he was the OWNER.  Great I thought.  Surely he would care that a customer who comes so often and spends a fairly good deal of money there had a valid complaint.  Well, not only did he not care, he again told me that I was a liar and didn't really care that our food came out wrong, cold, old and after half of our party had finished the meals that they ordered.  Apparently he didn't realize that they ordered two different meals and FINISHED one complete meal and began working on their second meals before two people were even served.  

Restaurants are entitled to a bad day.  And, with how busy they were the day after Christmas, I know things happen but for the OWNER cant be bothered and calls his customers (whether a first time customer or a loyal one) liars, that's just going too far.

From appearance, the gravy looked to contain a lot of sausage, but he couldn't taste any sausage juice in the sauce. Also, Jack put inadequate heavy cream or butter milk and instead choose to put a lot of flour to thicken the sauce which added no flavor to the taste. It was a very disappointing breakfast.

There was no wait for anyone except us as there were several reservations Monday, June 4, 2012 around 6:45PM.  We told the host we needed a table for 2 as he looked around the restaurant and told us he had no idea how long we would be waiting (I thought he would have had a  seating chart/map in front of him.  We saw several tables open up in the main dining area, but we were put in the back with the reservation for the party of 50. 

We ordered the BBQ boneless chicken wings, which were quite tasty, but a little over-breaded.  I then asked for a side salad with the dressing on the side, which my salad came with the dressing right on my salad.  My waiter saw me looking at my salad and I had hoped he would have remembered that I take my dressing on the side, but instead brought me more dressing.  For dinner, I ordered the Sautéed Petrale Sole, that looked like a bunch of broken pieces of filet put together to make it look like a whole piece of a filet.  My food came out warm, but definitely not fresh.  The mashed potatoes served with my meal was fluffy and flavorful, but the seasonal vegetables were a disappointment.  The colors of the veggies were faded as if they had been made a while ago and just thrown onto my plate as my order was completed.  My friend ordered the Half Chicken, which had the same exact veggies, most likely from the same batch as mine.

I have to agree with the other reviewer's statements that the service is just ok, but honestly, there is nothing that I would come back for.  Definitely going to put this on my list of One-Hit Wonders as the food wasn't horrible, but it wasn't spectacular either.  I will never go back, but I gave it that one chance, which was quite disappointing.",3.0,2012-06-05,0.11,0.318,0.572,365
903,Alma C.,I've become a regular.  I was first introduced by my friend to their hamburgers.  Excellent.  Meat cooked just the way I ordered it.  The fries are crisp on the outside and tender on the inside.  I have now ventured to other parts of the menu and am completely satisfied.  The clam chowder has real clams and not just a bunch of potatoes like other places.  The Gyros are wonderful.  Their full-sized salads are fresh and crisp.

Thai salad is decent. 
The Asian salad is good but the dressing could use a little more sesame oil.  The shrimp, hearts of palm salad is very fresh, it's adequate, but the hearts of palm they use are rather tasteless. I know: hearts of palm run the gamut from subtle to tasteless, but let's try to go with subtle on this one, OK?
The greet-staff is friendly, the wait-staff runs the gamut from perfunctory to outstanding.

916,Ashley V.,"This restaurant recently opened across the street from Tanforan Shopping Center. Although it is located next to the freeway, the never-ending traffic of El Camino Real, and the planes flying overhead from SFO,  the decor and construction of the building appropriately disguises its location. Once you sit down, you won't notice all of the distractions from outside. 

The restaurant is extremely clean and has a contemporary home-style decor. It is filled with comfy booths in neutral colors and warm wood furniture. The bar has a couple of flat screen TVs for the guys who don't want to miss the score of a game. The service staff are friendly and prompt. 

Jack's has a fairly extensive menu, which clearly shows that they want to appeal to every customer. However, with that diversity comes mediocrity. The food isn't horrible, it isn't incredible, it's just okay. My recommendation for dinner is the meatloaf, which comes with creamy mashed potatoes and crunchy friend onion rings on top.  

For those who wish to drive here individually from their party, there is limited parking. Every night, there's an endless stream of people trying to find a spot, particularly during the dinner rush from 7pm-9pm. I would recommend that your party takes one car and hope that there's a spot. 

Overall, okay restaurant option if you're in the area. (It would be ideal for a tired mother who wants to take the night off from cooking.) The prices are reasonable enough to justify a night out, but it's definitely not noteworthy enough for an intimate special occasion.",3.0,2011-04-17,0.083,0.179,0.738,260
917,Stu P.,"Been to Jack's in San Bruno for lunch with different people several times in the past few months and never disappointed. Very good service with a meal that arrives only a few minutes after ordering. The servings are large portions, fresh and tasty, not like the salt-lick chains that all taste the same. I usually get some kind of sandwich and salad. I've had the Turkey club (huge triple decker); or the Grilled Chicken Pesto Sandwich (delicious); and most recently the Tuna Melt. They're always hot and tasty. The salads are cool and crisp with tasty dressings. The person I was with most recently had fries with his meal and they about covered his entire plate. Jack's does not skimp on the portions. It's always busy with normal everyday people enjoying their meals. I've seen Firefighters, Police Officers, Seniors, and everyday office folks all dining at the same time. I try to time it after the lunch hour rush. A very pleasant environment with large, thick napkins that you will need. Not too many places like Jack's anymore.",5.0,2016-03-04,0.88,0.087,0.034,178

The manager came out to verify my cousin's age and my cousin presented a Mexican Driver License. The manager said ""My husband is Mexican and his doesn't look like this"". My sister said, he might be from a different state. She said, ""He's from el D.F.""
Excuse me Lady, just because you are Married to a Mexican does not give you the right or the authority to think you know everything about Mexico. And you are so ignorant to think that my cousin's ID is fake just because it looks different.

932,Tiffany O.,"Always wanted to try Jacks because while I like the ambiance of BJs (across the street), I do not enjoy their food. That being said, Jack's food is pretty decent for their prices. However, be warned...  their food does not look as tasty as their pictures. I had the double breasted chicken that came with veg tables and mashed potatoes. My date had the Tutto Mare (seafood pasta). And everything was decent. Portion sizes were just enough but taste-wise, it was nothing spectacular or had me craving more. Therefore, their prices match the quality of food. Just about right. 

Aside from that, their ambiance is missing something. It was very vanilla, solidly a good flavor but still lacking more. It needs to be better decorated to make you feel cozier since it is a family restaurant. They put nice booths and tables together but the decor, lighting needs to tie the place together. I am not a decorator or a restaurant expert, but just like their food, it can be better.

Aside from their mediocre food and decor, their service staff is in need of some dire training. They have no hostess even though they have a hostess podium. My date and I were waiting to be seated, just to find out that the couple before us had not been helped for ten minutes. When we finally waved down a random waitress, she gave us a buzzer and we sat at the bar. While I was sipping on my drink the manager (dressed differently from the staff) approached me and asked, ""Are you waiting for a table?"" I showed him my buzzer and responded, ""Yes"". He then looked annoyed and pointed at a table and said,"" Well your suppose to sit there."" I am not very confrontational but for the ten minutes we were sitting at the bar the buzzer didn't alert me that our table was ready. My date asked the bartender if he could pay for the drinks and the bartender responded, "" That's my table anyways, I'll just add it to your tab"" A bartender that seconds as a waiter... odd. When we were still looking at our menus our Bartender/ Waiter comes up to us to give us the soup of the day by saying, ""FYI the soup of the day is corn tortilla, ok?"" Overall just a weird, uneasy service experience. 

I plan to come back for breakfast since fellow yelpers rave about it, but other than that Jacks will just be another restaurant forgotten in my book.

Not bad.  The parking is crappy here - It's nestled against some new apartment complexes.  So happy hour or trying to get something to eat here during dinner is a B*tch!  But we were lucky to find a great parking space - it was timing.  

This place is kind of like a sports bar too b/c they've got flat screen tv's not only mounted where the bar is but also in the dining areas.  That's cool!  The restaurant is nice and clean, I hope it is maintained through the years but you can definitely tell this had just opened.  I like the restaurant it'self.  As for the food we chose on the menu, the calamari is good (nothing to rave about).  The garlic fries - another average one.  Portions of these appetizers were nice.  I ordered Petrale Sole as my main entree and though when I asked if the Sole had bones, small fish bones were present so I ended up ordering Fish and Chips - the batter on the fish were overly fried.  The batter was more than crunch, it was kinda hard when you bite down.  Though the fish itself was fresh.  Also got a kid plate of spaghetti and meals for my toddler and it was good too.  Hubby got a sandwich which I can't remember what he got - but he was pleased with it.  Service was okay - our waitress was friendly.  Though another waitress came up to me to attend to us and I asked her for plastic utensils for my toddler - she never returned with them.

It means the vegetables, the meats, the salads, unless otherwise certified organic, contain Roundup, and some other things that might just be causing those strange symptoms you might be having.  

A new generation of insect larvae is eating the roots of genetically engineered corn intended to be resistant to such pests. The failure of Monsanto's genetically modified Bt corn could be the most serious threat ever to a genetically modified crop in the U.S.

And the economic impact could be huge. Billions of dollars are at stake, as Bt corn accounts for 65 percent of all corn grown in the US.

The strain of corn, engineered to kill the larvae of beetles, such as the corn rootworm, contains a gene copied from an insect-killing bacterium called Bacillus thuringiensis, or Bt. 

Frightening but true, you can watch, or read more about this here:  http://geneticroulettemovie.com/  or here:
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/30/gmo-labeling-food-just-label-it_n_1391459.html 

All this thanks to Jack's for not allowing me to substitute their GMO vegatbles for some other side dish, even when i wanted to pay extra for it.  Because I ordered by fish with mashed potatoes, hold the veggies, i was branded a problem customer.  

Don't get it???  Not that Jack's Restaurants & Bars are the only restaurants knowingly or unknowingly serving their customers GMO engineered foods.  Due to the lack of proper labeling laws, blocked by the company that makes the GMO products, it is tedious to ferret out the non-toxic foods, but a necessity if one considers food an important element to their existence.  

Demand wholesome foods, without pesticides, that poison your body.  Don't go to public restaurants that are not NON-GMO certified.   Poison the corn.  Use the corn to feed the cow.  Eat the cow, Eat the orn.  Get poisoned either way.  Poison the Soy.  Use the soy to feed the chicken.  Eat the soy, Eat the chicken.  Get poisoned either way.  Spray the lettuce,......................................  The GMO company has and is trying to introduce GMO into everything that exists, and all for economic gain.

It's also nice that they have their own parking lot and on a Fri lunch rush, they weren't too busy as my party was seated right away and our food came out pretty quickly.",3.0,2012-03-18,0.039,0.112,0.849,85

945,Danielle R.,"No, No, NO! This place is all bad. My husband and I have been here once and once was enough!

Since we live in the apartments within steps away, we were hoping that Jack's would be the answer to our ""We're-too-exhausted-from-work-to-cook-tonight"" nights and sadly we were let down. Heavily.

The food is nothing to brag about. It's either too bland or too salty. Mostly too salty. Why was my Angus beef chili nothing but ground meat and cheddar cheese? 7 beans and a few tomatoes here and there, do not make for a good chili. I sent it back.

The service was horrible. How many times do we have to ask for a water refill? How many times do I have to ask for my hot tea, only to be brought hot water and no tea options? And, why do I have to flag you down? Why do you not check on us? Really? I, once, was a server and understand what goes into this job, so I'm actually more forgiving than the ""non server"" folk, so for me to complain is no good.

On a side-note, I had an interesting run-in with the owner/manager/whatever the hell he is, of the restaurant. My husband and I were on our way home in the loaner vehicle fresh from the dealer, when our friend called us to say he's at Jack's asking if we cared to join him. We hadn't been to Jack's yet at this point and decided, ""What the hey - why not?"" We parked in the oh-so tiny parking lot with the loaner. After our (awful) dining experience was through, we decided to venture elsewhere for some dessert. We were going to ride-share with our friend and take the loaner back to our apartment's garage. My husband hopped in our friend's car while I was a few seconds behind. Literally seconds - and in those few fleeting moments, the loaner would not start. Uh-oh... what's the problem here? I step out of the car into the empty space next to me to flag my husband and friend down. Mind you, my ""step out"" was with one foot out and the door half way open. I honk and wave to get their attention. At that split second, a Dodge Charger (literally) charges and honks at me to get into the empty parking space. I wave and give him the look of ""Oops, sorry!"" and hop back into the car not before noticing him do the ""jack-ass-throw-his-hands-up"" pose at me. As ""Jack Ass"" finally parks his monstrous beast of a car and heads into the restaurant, my husband comes to check out the loaner. While we're talking about the car's issue, etc., the Jack Ass returns and says something along the lines of ""I just realized you ate at my restaurant. Was there something going on with you car? Did you need us to call Triple A?"" I reply back with a sarcastic ha and ""No thanks"".

Too little too late, Jack Ass. Had you not tried to run me over, honk at me, and do the ""what the f"" hand throw - I might have actually saved you from writing this review. But too bad... my experience with you, Mr. Jack Ass, was the icing on the cake to my (underwhelming) experience at Jack's.",1.0,2012-01-21,0.046,0.183,0.771,554

The food was DELICIOUS. I recommend the chili cheese fries, so amazing!  I was impressed, and honestly, I prefer Jack's to BJ's, even if it's across the street.

The bar area doesn't even have a partiition to separate from the dining area.  It really is a sight for sore eyes.  

Anyway, we get there and there is a 20 minute wait.  We only go there mainly to try the mac 'n cheese.  It isn't the best, but it  isn't that bad either.  For dessert, we ordered the creme brulee.  That wasn't bad , but it all taste the same to me.  We had left overs of the mac 'n cheese and when you heated it up, you see nothing but OIL!  Not cool yo.

950,Derlie Ann T.,"Sissy sung an early Mass (9:30AM) so the family decided to try and FINALLY swing by Jack's. The parking lot is pretty small but since it was still really early, parking wasn't that hard to find. I can imagine on a busy (Friday and Saturday) night the parking would probably be a hassle... But then again, it is conveniently located right across the street from the mall that has PLENTY of parking places. The interior of the location was like a breath of fresh air. High ceilings, good lighting, very spacious and not cramped. Simple, yet with a modern elegance. The staff was very courteous and attentive and professional. Now, for the best part, THE FOOD.
I had the Mama Eleni's Meatloaf: Mashed potatoes topped with mushrooms, meatloaf, gravy and onion rings. I should have ordered a side of veggies. 
Mom got the Tuscan Sandwich: grilled eggplant, roasted red peppers, mozzarella, pesto on a french roll with a side salad. The flavors were well balanced in the sandwich and the bread was toasted just right. The salad had a vinaigrette dressing and could have used a little sweetness to my tastes (maybe cranberries).  
Sissy got the Tutto Mare: spaghetti, prawns, clams, mussels, red snapper, white wine, marinara, parsley, garlic, chili flakes. Very saucy compared to other ones we have tried (good thing for bread soaking after) :) They give you a side dish of freshly grated cheese to sprinkle yourself to your liking. It has a little kick to it with the chili flakes. The seafood was cooked to a perfect consistency.
Dad had the Sunset Boulevard Burger: bacon, avocado, jack and cheddar cheese, grilled sourdough. I didn't get a chance to pick at his food because I can tell when I do it kinda bothers him (lol). He looked like he enjoyed it though and that's the burger my sis always gets.  I did try the fries. *thumbs up*
For dessert sis raved about the Chocolate Indulgence cake. It's a flour-less, gluten-free cake, with a pecan crust. It was awesome.
We also shared the Pumpkin Bread Pudding. It caught my eye on the menu because I love pumpkin bread and mom loves bread pudding. :) It was AWESOME. Warm pumpkin bread with warm pumpkin puree underneath topped with a cool whipped cream. :) YUM
We agreed that we are gonna try everything on the menu by the end of the year. The food is SO good, well portioned, good prices, and awesome customer service. We will be back and we will recommend. :)",5.0,2011-04-24,0.185,0.515,0.3,424

But, after checking out this place I remembered why I deal with parking meters and expensive valet.  My visit was on a Friday night and I should've known by the half full parking lot there was a lot to be desired by this place.  Our hostess was a monotone teenager who couldn't even look at you while speaking.  And, oh, lucky us.  She was our waitress too.  The restaurant was clean and the bar was nice and open but the food sucked.  I had a chicken parmesan that I could've cooked myself in 4 ingredients or less.

Then, Jack's hired a goofy bartender who had worked at BJ's (one of the reasons I stopped going to BJ's).  I emailed one of the owners complaining about the Bartender, and never got a response.

It tries to pass itself as the high end answer to BJ's (across the street and equally as awful) but it COMPLETELY misses the mark on all levels.

(ratings based out of 10)

AESTHETICS: 8.0   It's that type of generic ""nice"" but hardly anything special. Well at least it's not dirty (as far as i know of?!!)

SERVICE: 5.0    The hosts looked bored and prefer talk to each other rather than give updates to patiently waiting patrons. Our server was very pleasant but often forgot details from our order and had to be reminded multiple times (such as... drink orders/refills, condiments, etc...) After our order was placed... then the real wait began!!!! NO ONE SHOULD EVER HAVE TO WAIT THAT LONG FOR 2 BURGERS, FISH n' CHIPS AND MAC&CHEESE (the famed SUNSET BURGER was hardly anything great! You could order the EXACT same burger from MIMI's CAFE for nearly half the price and better prepared! The FISH n' CHIPS were soooooo soggy that you could probably squeeze dry your fish. I completely understand the desire for juicy flavorful fish but you should NOT have to drink the juice as you are chewing. The MAC&CHEESE was disgusting. In fact, it didn't even have enough flavor to be disgusting. It is a prime example of what ""nothing"" would taste like?!!)

OVERALL:  6.0   All this is something that could be fine tuned over time. Since this is a new restaurant, they have to work out their kinks.

as of right now,  Jack's is to fine dining as MAROON 5 are to LED ZEPPELIN!

Jack's has a nice, clean ambience.  The waitress was very good, and the food was tasty.  I can't remember the last time I've had a better breakfast.

960,Marie L.,"The first few times we tried this restaurant, I wasn't too impressed... probably because we ordered take out. The service was slow, both times the food wasn't ready when I showed up (one time I waited an additional 10-15 minutes). The boxes they provide are not ideal for to-go orders. This is why I gave Jacks 4 stars instead of 5. I'll gladly change my rating if I have a positive to-go experience. 

I've visited the restaurant on two other occasions when we had the time to sit and enjoy the atmosphere. Both of these experiences were EXCELLENT!

The wait staff has great attitude and works together well. All the food looks tasty; its hard not to look around and see what others are ordering. One time I ordered the polenta (I was hesitant because polenta usually isn't the best at a bar and grill) and it was great, cleaned my plate! My husband has tried the fish & chips and the meatloaf. Both were tasty and well prepared. 

I can see how the to-go food wouldn't be as good. The presentation of the food is neat and appetizing, unfortunately you just don't get the same effect with the to-go orders.

The atmosphere is busy, noise level is moderate, bar area is fairly good sized and the restaurant is well lit, modern and inviting.

962,C P.,"Jack's is a wonderful new addition to San Bruno. Because San Bruno has a very sad downtown, and lacks any upscale restaurants, this is definitely a step in the right direction.

As far as the restaurant interior, I'd give it about a 3. The front door is very unassuming and looks like the front door of a doctor's office rather than a restaurant. I think they should get a more inviting door that really makes you feel like you're entering a restaurant...

Inside the tables are very close together and the layout is a bit awkward, but the boots are very long and comfortable.

The people working here are all VERY friendly, and make you feel welcomed immediately. We live in the apartments next door, and it is SO nice to be able to walk here, and then truly be made to feel at home.

We ordered the sweet potatoe fries for an appetizer (the chipotle mayo was a little too too mayo-y, needed more chipotle), but overall very good. My husband had a cup of the greek soup which he enjoyed. My cocktail, the ""pomegranate in a pear tree,"" wasn't amazing...I plan on trying a different cocktail next time.

I ordered the Sole for my entree, and it was FANTASTIC. The fish was so tender, in a very delicious sauce which just melted in my mouth. The mashed potatoes had just the right hint of garlic, and the seasonal vegetables on the side were perfection!!! Not bland at all...

My husband had the thai steak salad, which I felt was a little soggy. We ordered the cheesecake for dessert (one of the best slices of cheesecake I've ever had).

I can't wait to try many more of the dishes on the menu. The menu is not neccesarily the most creative, or hippest...but I don't think it's trying to be either. It's quality, homey, cozy food that warms you up and makes you feel good inside.

What really made our lunch fantastic were the genuine employees, from the waitresses to the busboys. Granted they JUST opened, they still need to get the service in a rythym, which is understandable. (at times service was a tad slow), but I have faith that after a few months this place will be even BETTER, and if so I'll upgrade it to 5 stars. I'm biased, because I live next door, and I want to see this place succeed. It's so nice to have a local joint to walk to when you really don't feel like cooking.

To sum it up, it's not some fancy 5 star restaurant with exotic, eclectic dishes, but it IS a very family oriented, cozy place with a great menu that makes you want to come back.",4.0,2011-02-26,0.319,0.247,0.434,458

I didn't know the prices since they gave our school a customized smaller menu to choose from, but when i came back home, I looked up the menu online. And the prices aren't bad. 

Although for our group, we waited 1 hour for our food, it was a bit disappointing. I was soo famished. And some of my colleagues were annoyed, esp because we pre-ordered all the dishes in advance so they knew what our orders were. It was just busy, weekday lunch crowd.

Desserts range from gigantic (banana split) to slightly grainy (the creme brulee) to smooshy and disappointing (the pumpkin bread pudding - but maybe I just feel like pumpkin is too seasonal to be served year round).

Most of the people in my group ordered a variation of the macaroni and cheese. My friend S got the Italian Mac which had Italian sausage and sun dried tomatoes in it. I thought the sun dried tomatoes gave the mac n cheese really good flavor contrast. The Italian sausage was also generous in the mac so thumbs up for that. I got the hot dog mac which was just chopped up hot dogs in mac and cheese. The servings were large, so I had it again the next day. It was definitely a very hearty meal.

Both times the restaurant was pretty full, (a good sign to me) and our wait to get a table was not too long at all.  They have a nice bar and a great selection of alcohol, wine, and beer.  Both time I have ordered the salsbury steak, medium cooked w mashers, and veggies.    Now Ive only eaten a salsbury steak ala frozen food hungry man tv dinner, but never at a restaurant.  Actually I think this was the first time Ive seen salsbury steak on a menu, so I had to try it.  Let me tell you, it was scrumtously delicious.  Its a heavy portion, (probably like 2500 calories) but nice meat and potatoes meal.  My wife had the caesar salad and yankee pot roast and that was also a great choice.

People were friendly and customer service was great. If anyone has been to Boulevard in Daly City, well the owners of that place are cousin's of this place owners so the menu is almost the same. I had a cheese burger with Bacon and Fries. Now for anyone who knows a cheese burger isnt a pound of hamburger. Well thats what i got. I was surprise and it was good. My parents shared a philly cheese sandwich. They liked it and said it was good.

The Banana's Foster French toast is amazing, but not overly sweet. 

I've been here twice since it opened and have found the service to be quite good, and the food yummy.

986,A in Pleasant H.,"I went for opening day.

I'm a regular at the east-bay location, so its nice to have a familiar place in a location nearby my work.  

What impressed me most is that they seem to have hired excellent staff members. I sat at the bar and chatted with the bartenders as well as some of the passing waitstaff.  OK - so they don't have their liquor license yet.  I watched some patrons act nasty about no-booze-yet; the bartenders handled the complaints with aplomb, and did everything they could to satisfy the customer.

My meal was excellent, although I expected that - I'm a fan of their cobb salad.  The people sitting next to me, also east bay regulars, said that one of their items was not only excellent, but a little better than the east bay location.

For opening day, the staff sure knew how to accommodate special requests.

988,D E.,"The food is good and the portions are huge. My friend, her boyfriend, and I shared the California Mac, fish-n-chips, and Sunset Boulevard burger.

The California Mac was tasty--a perfect mix of cheesy and creamy, but definitely too rich to eat an entire portion in one sitting. I wouldn't have minded if the cheese they used was a bit sharper, or if they offered half- or side-portions. (I may not always have friends who will want to share with me!)

The fish-n-chips came with three huge pieces of fish that came in a light, crispy batter. I think Jack's may make their own tartar sauce. It was milder and more sour-creamy than the usual bottled stuff that comes with fried seafood. (I liked it.)

The Sunset Boulevard burger came loaded with toppings. My only complaint was that we ordered it medium-rare, and it came out well-done and really dry. I loved the sweet potato fries we got with it, and the chipotle mayo was surprisingly good.

997,Teri T.,"Wow, after reading the mixed reviews for Jack's, I'm surprised. People either really like it or really hate it. As you can see I gave it 3 stars. Reasoning? As follows:
Parking: the parking lot is not too large, but at least they've got one. Found a spot immediately even though we could see there was a wait. Remember, it was around 8 pm on a Saturday night. So, finding parking right away was a definate plus.
We were greeted promptly by the 3 hostess' and told it would be a 30 minute wait which was OK. We'd been wanting to try Jack's since we do like The Boulevard in Daly City. Yes, they are related.
Nice that you're given a pager iinstead of constantly hearing names called out. Adds a bit of class to the place.
Small waiting area with seats - indoors and out.
We didn't have any drinks, but the bar area looked nice, wasn't overcrowded nor too noisy.
The restaurant is large and spaced out. Nice because I don't like to overhear other  conversations.
Our waitress came over immediately to check on us and give us menus. Warm bread was served right away and very good. Water also was served immediately.
We had checked out the menu while waiting,so we all knew what we wanted.
We ordered the Deep Fried Calamari appetizer. It was very good. It was brought immediately to our table, served with two dipping sauces. Light and crispy. 
This is where the disappointing part comes in.......we had to wait a pretty long time for our food. They did bring us extra bread right away and we understand that it's Saturday night and the restaurant was filled but.......if you've got a restaurant that big, well.... you've got to have a kitchen large enough to handle a FULL restaurant. 
When the food finally came, it was good. Hadn't been sitting out. My husband had the meatloaf. Very nice presentation, a large piece of meatloaf on top of the mashed potatoes with 2 large onion rings on top. Very nice. He said it was very good and the sauce was slightly bar-be-quey.
My daughter had the Mac/Cheese with chicken. California pasta, I guess. It was too cheesy for her taste but she did say it was good.
I had the American Burger. A nice sized patty, the beef was very good and cooked medium rare as requested. The sweet potatoes fries were very good too, but at an additional cost of $1.50.
Overall, the meal was good, but it was the service that was lacking.
After our meal we declined dessert. Then it took FOREVER to get our bill. Af least 20 minutes. I thought our waitress had gone home. 
I guess we're just used to better service than we were provided.

I prefer going there for breakfast and like to sit at the full bar to watch sports on the flat screen TVs, have a bloody mary, and ham it up the the lively bartenders, especially Rosa. Table service is excellent and the menu is varied enough for every age group and budget.  For example, my family would order mac & cheese, a hamburger, meatloaf, and middle eastern plate.  They serve good portions and the food comes out of the kitchen fast . Their food is good to very good and is what you would expect for the price point.

The ambience inside is nice. There are tables and booths. It reminded me of an upscale BJ's (across the street) minus the wall decor but with lots of natural light. 
The service was good and prompt. I noticed while we were there, that it filled up quickly-thus the always-packed parking lot. The menu consists of hambugers, sandwiches (I think?), pastas and meat entrees. I tried the orzo salmon. It had a different texture than expected but it was still good, not dry. My friend got the shrimp scampi pasta, which I wanted to get too, and said BJ's was better because they had a bigger serving portion. lol

Ok so, they've just opened their doors, so I'll be posting an update, for sure, when we go back... and, we WILL be going back.
This place seems a bit higher class than the BJs across the street with a bit of a Greek flair to the menu. We had...

Ruben w/Potato Salad - Ruben was good... not nearly as much meat as Max's Opera, but tasted good. Potato Salad was 5 stars... maybe the best I've had.

Souvlaki w/Fries - Grilled chicken sandwich was good. Fries were really exceptional. Really, really good fries.

Spaghetti and Clams w/caesar salad - Very good. Believe it or not, a lot of places no longer serve a spaghetti with a white wine clam sauce, so it's nice to have a very good version. Ceasar was good, not over dressed. croutons were homemade and awesome.

Chili - 2-3 stars. Go across the street to BJs for chili. It's still the best.

We'll def be going back for breakfast and will probably hit up their Happy Hour once they get their liquor license sorted.

1019,Brian W.,"I've been wanting to try Jack's for some time. Upon entering, there first thing I noticed was that it was clean, with a different ambiance. The clientele is elderly or older business professionals. Not your typical burger/bar crowd.

We were promptly seated and the waiter came by with water and bread. We ordered a burger and fish and chips. The waiter came back a second time to give us more bread as we waited. When we received our food my fish and chips was just okay - a little over fried with too much batter. My fiancee's burger was so raw she had to send it back. She and I shared my fish in chips until her burger came back out. I was impressed that the staff took care of the raw burger without a fuss. This was really good service.

I really wanted to like this place but the food was really average. There was no flavor in the fish or the burger. If they tweak the food, they just might have a winner.",3.0,2011-05-12,0.29,0.535,0.174,175

As we came off the 380 exit the parking for BJ's was insane so i pointed out Jack's across the street. We discovered it was just as busy, but we lucked out with bar seating. Really awesome garlic, oregano fries. Onion rings: beer battered is not my favorite kind (i like more of a panko type crust) but they were sweet and pretty good. We both got burgers. Visually appealing burgers, generous with beef patties AND cooked exactly the way I asked - med rare. Even Jack's Prime and the Counter can't get it right. The burgers in general were fine, although I can't say that either really had much flavor or taste, but they were good. just can't put my finger on what's missing...seasoning? Not sure. I was slathering the chipotle sauce on my burger for some flavor. We sat at the bar and I have to say, the service was great. Really friendly bartenders who took our food orders. Good job here. We both really liked this place and will surely go back....me especially for the garlic oregano fries. in my mind, there can't be enough garlic on those puppies.",4.0,2012-06-19,0.068,0.212,0.72,211
1021,Jill M.,"Decided to try Jack's in San Bruno...with mixed results.  We made a reservation at the last minute and there were a number of people waiting but we were able to get in quickly.  Our server was very attentive and nice.  We decided to order a number of items to share to get a well rounded experience of the restaurant's offerings.  One highlight was the pomegranate in a pear tree cocktail.  It was on the strong side so I definitely got my money's worth.  We also tried the onion rings which were good and the Caesar salad which was so so--not much flavor to the salad dressing. 
One pet peeve that I have is being served my entrée before finishing my appetizer/salad.  I'm all for efficient service but a different server delivered our entrees while we were finishing our appetizers.   Now I understand this isn't France, and I'm not planning on spending 2 hours at this café, but really...  can I at least be allowed to finish my appetizer before you interrupt my meal and cram other dishes on the table?
Moving on to the main courses was the biggest disappointment.  I'm not someone who watches my sodium intake so I'm pretty  liberal with the salt but I had the blackened catfish and is was so salty it was inedible!  My husband had the spaghetti with clams and thought his dish was just okay. 
Our regular server returned and asked if we wanted our leftovers.  I told her no and then told her my opinion of the overly salted catfish (this restaurant really needs to hear this since I'm now reading on Yelp that others have had the same saline experience).

The onion rings were good, as were the calamari. The chili mac and cheese reminded me of hamburger helper . . . just more expensive. The Sunset Burger was a little greasy for me and came to me warm, not hot. The cheese didn't really melt and it looked like sandwich cheese. The avocado was piled on top of each other, so I didn't get to it until I got to the middle of the burger. I wanted to have dessert, but with the missing waiter and sub par food I didn't want to be disappointed. I'm not sure if I want to give Jack's another chance.",2.0,2011-04-01,0.002,0.017,0.981,138
1023,Sandra S.,"After passing by for weeks I finally buckled down and stopped in to try. 
The restaurant is modern and clean, our waitress was really nice and attentive, with that said let's move onto the food. 

I started with a cup of french onion soup, it wasn't your typical bowl of french onion soup which I know should be a refreshing change, but this was heavy on spices yet not very flavorful, with minimal shredded cheese on top (to me the layer of baked cheese is supposed to be one of the best parts!). 

For an entree, I had the angel hair pomodoro with chicken, I think this was the high point of the meal for me. There was a fair portion of chicken, the seasoning and sauce was light and nice. For dessert I had the pumpkin bread pudding, I don't know if it was just that day's preparation but I was not impressed, it was piping hot but watery and lacking in taste.

We met the owner and he seemed genuinely concerned that we were enjoying ourselves, which I appreciated. That being said, it's not like anything was inedible, and I'm willing to give it another try, perhaps there are some gems on the menu that I just missed. I'd love to try their breakfast.

1024,Elijah C.,"I live within walking distance of this particular Jacks location and when I first moved to San Bruno about a year ago I was extremely pleased with the quality of the food and service.  Over the next six months I experienced the decline in BOTH.  I finally had to stop recommending Jacks and giving people high expectations after several friends complained that the food was not prepared accurately and service was sub par.  I personally spoke to the manager on numerous occasions about my frustrations with my food or someone in my groups food being prepared in accurately or the service just lacking.  I grew so frustrated with the lack of concern that not only me but several of my friends and associates stopped eating at this location for several months.  Within the last month I have tried to go back and I would say 4/5 times the food was prepared not as ordered and most recently (TODAY) the meal that was brought out wasn't even what I ordered at all.  I would recommend this Jacks location if you don't really care about accuracy, and don't mind your food being brought out after everyone else has already finished their meal.",2.0,2013-11-05,0.847,0.125,0.028,200

Cash and the remaining balance on a card. The rude waiter was insisting me that I should just keep the cash and put the whole balance on my card.

I first went here with a girlfriend and her family, we had 10 people all together. Before being seated, which wasn't a long wait, we enjoyed some wine and cocktails at the bar. The bar is very nice and the music playing in the front room is upbeat and trendy, but not to trendy where your grandmother would feel uncomfortable. Upon being served my chicken picatta (so yummy!) the service was absolutely wonderful. The waitress even remembered me the a week later when I brought my parents in.

Yes, there are some issues with the service, namely hostesses getting the waiting times right and waiters becoming acclimated with the menu. However, the people are beyond polite -- they're friendly and cordial. The food is good and the owners are a blast to meet if you get the chance.

Got there at 6 and was seated right away.  We were glad we got there early because during the hours plus we were there, it got really busy.  The service was so-so, they got our salad orders mixed up and than our entree's took a really long time.  

The food was excellent though, we were all very pleased and also left stuffed.  I ordered the petite steak and am always worried if my steak will be overdone and dry but it wasn't, it was cooked perfectly, tender and juicy.  It came with vegetables and mashed potatoes which were really creamy and tasty.  My husband ordered the red snapper which was excellent as well.  We also got some desserts: apple pie, banana split and creme brulle which were all so good that even as full as we were we couldn't stop eating it.

1039,Eva S.,"of the three times i've been to jack's, i've only gotten take out (during the early lunch hour) so i can't really speak for the service, only the food. and even then, the food was ""eck"". the first thing that surprised me about the order was the lack of bread. usually at restaurants like these, they will ask if you would like complimentary bread, they didn't but i assumed it was included; it wasn't. it might not be a given at all restaurants and i was going to let it slide until i read that they do provide the bread. but i guess you have to ask for it if it's take out, which i feel like i shouldn't have to do. they should ask me if i would like any and give me that option instead of none. 

for my first order i got the california mac and cheese and the first thing i noticed was the bits of burnt cheese. i guess it's suppose to be that top layer of cheese where it's melted and crisped up enough to form a nice sort of topping over the rest of the dish. there wasn't a lot of it but enough for you to notice that burnt cheese smell. i'm not talking about just slightly over browned cheese, it was burnt. as in black, burnt. i picked it off and the rest of the dish seemed ok. given that it felt a bit heavy as i continued to eat it but i knew that was a possibility so no points deducted there. only deductions are for the burnt cheese and lack of bread.

the second time, i ordered a breakfast time, the moose. not the mighty moose, just the moose. what went wrong? my order, i asked for sausage instead of the usual bacon and when i brought it home to eat, there was bacon; tons of bacon. minus one point there for getting the order wrong even though i saw the hostess take down the order for sausage instead of bacon. the biscuits were ok but the gravy was sooo salty. that was another reason i didn't want the bacon. bacon can be pretty darn salty and if something else in the dish has enough salt, adding bacon to it will throw you into sodium land. second point deducted for over seasoning.

the third and last order was for the fish and chips. i specifically asked for onion rings instead of fries and paid extra for the onion rings. no prob with the extra charge since some places do, do that. again, had to ask for bread. same as my previous orders. when i picked it up, i decided to check it since they got my order wrong last time. lo and behold there were the fries, hanging out next to my fish. i took it back to them and told them they got my order wrong. they were very nice and promptly fixed it. unfortunately the fish got soggy really quickly even though i left the box opened on the way home so the heat wouldn't get absorbed by the crispy fish. it was no more than a 5 minute drive and the fish didn't even survive that.

to sum it up, i won't be coming back to jack's unless the food and service improves; mostly the food. i placed the orders when i got there, not through the phone, so my food wasn't sitting there for a longer period of time. given that the host/hostess was very nice, getting my order wrong twice in a row is a bit unacceptable. the chef's/cook's should've paid attention to order and whoever was packaging the food should've checked it. so that process really needs improvement since two mistakes out of three tries is pretty bad. and i didn't even go there during a lunch rush. if you get my order wrong when it's not even busy, i hate to think what would happen during a lunch or dinner rush.

here are my suggestions based on my experiences with jack's:
- go easy on the salt, i don't want a ticket to sodium land, i have no interest in it at all
- pay attention to the orders, especially for the takeouts. we don't like to go home and find surprises and these aren't good surprises. it just leaves a sour impression
- improve your checking process. the chef may be the one doing the cooking but if he get's it wrong, the server or whoever's packing up the food should look at the order again to make sure it's right. that way, you reduce your chances of screwing up an order and an unhappy customer",1.0,2012-09-15,0.008,0.08,0.912,785
1040,Lee I.,"I've had two 'A-OK' experiences at Jacks so far. 

Happy Hour - 
Bartender seemed unprepared and a little unsure of things, which I suppose can be expected of a brand new restaurant. There were no happy hour menus printed out, and it took about 10 minutes just to figure out exactly what specials they were offering. After they worked through the kinks, things were fine. The Mediterranean sampler was decent, although it tasted very out-of-the-box, so to speak. The italian mac-n-cheese was a unique twist on a classic dish, and quite good!

Brunch - 
Seated within 10 minutes, prompt service, and overall average food. We ordered the chicken club and biscuits and gravy. The chicken club tasted as expected. The biscuits and gravy left something to be desired; the eggs, potatoes, and biscuits were fine, although the 'sausage gravy' was very bland, and there was barely enough to cover the tops of the biscuits.

End state - 
As others have said, this is a GREAT alternative to BJ's for a quick local meal, the menu is quite extensive, and the prices are fair. It will be interesting to see if their wait time stays manageable, and not like the 1-3 hours across the street. Now all that needs to happen is for that sorry excuse of a HOOTERS to get the boot, and another solid alternative like Jack's to take its place (at least something a step up from fridays/chilis type).",3.0,2011-03-11,0.104,0.279,0.617,241

Their salad dressings are all made ""in-house""... I chose their house vinaigrette, which was really good and unique. The bf agrees that the dressing was really good!

I ordered the Petite New York Steak Early Bird meal. The steak was just how I wanted it. The mashed potatoes were simple, but yummy! The veggies were buttery and cooked with garlic! MMMMMM! This simple meal hit the spot!

The bf got the fish and chips, which he was craving. They gave him big pieces of white fish and served it with crispy fries. It was such a big plate that he couldn't finish it!

1047,K Q.,"This review is for dinner take-out.  
I had a hankering for lamb tonight, and wanted no part of doing the dishes afterwards.  I checked Jack's on-line menu, and the description of their marinated, grilled lamb, feta-garlic potato wedges and sautéed spinach was really appealing.  Even though the price tag was a bit steeper ($27) than I usually go for, I decided to treat myself.  I found a 10% off coupon on line for take-out, and that helped. ;)
They had my order ready when I got there, and there was no problem changing my tab with the coupon.  They were really packing them in - parking lot full, quite a wait at the door - and it seemed really noisy to me, but no matter!  I was in and out in about 6 minutes.
Once home, I was thrilled with my meal.  Heated it a bit in the microwave, making the rare lamb more of the medium-rare that I prefer, so that worked out well. The only other drawback was that one potato wedge was mostly raw.  But the rest of the meal was magnificent!  Succulent, juicy lamb chops - a generous, 4-chop portion... the potatoes (the cooked ones, anyway) were savory, cheesy, garlicy-good.  Spinach was cooked perfectly.

First thing we noticed was that menu was almost identical to a place by a different name in Daily City.  We asked about it and we were told they were not connected.  Once we were finally served, we found out that it was totally different.  Our server was almost invisible.  When the salad arrived we had asked for extra ranch and some more butter for the bread as well as drink refills.  After about 10 minutes we received the Ranch and Butter.  When our main course arrived our server asked if we wanted refills on our drinks.  We said yes.  10 minutes later we received the refills.  The service only got worse after this.  The food wasn't overly good or nasty - it was just edible - absolutely nothing special.  Our dinner for 2 took over 90 minutes due to the very slow service - and even trying to get our bill and pay.  Our server was very bad and the main thing that was slowing down the service appeared to be that the servers were watching basketball on the televisions just about 10 feet from us and some up at the bar watching the game.

Also got a few cups of sangria, which was very good but it could have been stronger because I didn't feel the slightest buzz. We were still hungry so we ordered the bacon mac. This was really good but way too rich for me. I could only handle a few bites. During another visit I ordered The Hangover, which was yummy but a little bit too rich for me once again. Last visit (for now!), my bf and I were craving dessert yesterday. I ordered the pumpkin bread pudding which was really good, but a bit too custardy and soggy. Service has always been great each time. The waiters are very friendly and all seem to have a great sense of humor. The host seems to have memorized my face which is kind of embarrassing, but I don't care because I will be back!",4.0,2011-06-29,0.493,0.39,0.117,194

1066,Jewels J.,"I came here for lunch the 1st day it opened. The atmosphere makes you feel like you're in a cheap hotel lobby restaurant. The bar is not seperate and right on top of guests who are eating in the dining room. I got the Mac & Cheese w/ bacon. I have to say it was good....that was after waiting for almost a half hour for it to cool down enough to eat. It wasn't until I almost finished my glass of water that I noticed the glass was dirty & there were lipstick marks....Needless to say, I'm not coming back here.

1067,Charlene P.,"My first impressions of Jack's were very positive and I have been coming about once a week for about 7 months.  I am sorry to say the service and the food have taken a downturn in the last 7-8 weeks.  There is a disconnect between the server who takes your order and who delivers the food.  No one checks to ensure the order is correct.  In the past weeks, I have experienced lost orders, improperly prepared food, new staff that appear ill-trained and don't last long.  Once the order is taken you rarely see the server until they bring you the bill.  Also, these new servers appear to care less if your dining experience is good or not.  It has so much potential, but it appears no one is checking for quality in food or service.",2.0,2012-09-23,0.045,0.138,0.817,136
1068,Marjorie P.,Parking is horrible but the place is pretty snazzy :) the menu included breakfast items served til 2pm daily. Love that! I got the Denver omelette and the hubs got a Belgian waffle. Both were scrumptious and  large portion :) I like how there's a lot of choices in the menu but it's not so overboard that you're flipping through pages and pages and can't figure out what to order.  The restaurant is really nice... They've got a pretty bar with a couple flat screens. Reasonable prices for great food! I'll definitely be back to try the hangover and bacon Mac n cheese :),4.0,2012-02-01,0.663,0.264,0.073,104

1070,Efrain T.,"NEW American restaurant just opened up? Count me in!! I came in here with the family for lunch, and when I opened up the menu, I looked it over and thought, ""Huh, it kinda looks like the menu to Boulevard Cafe in Daly City. WAIT, this IS the Boulevard Cafe menu! Almost right down to the same font. Plagarism!?"" But no, Jack's Restaurant is actually owned by the same people who operate Boulevard Cafe. The menu's between the two restaurants are ALMOST the same, with differences here and there, i.e. Jack's has chocolate chip pancakes but Boulevard does not; you guys can compare the menus off their websites. However i didn't see any glaring differences between the menus so that's up to you to decide. But the food is great here, just like Boulevard. Definitely worth checking out.",4.0,2011-03-07,0.539,0.365,0.095,138
1071,Nicole L.,"Jack's is amazing! We went on a Saturday night smack in the middle of dinner rush and were exceptionally happy with our food. A must mention: I went with 3 foodies and they LOVED every thing. I started out with a side salad which was delicious with tomatoes, cucumbers, cheese, croutons, and nice dark lettuce. No filler stuff that's for sure. Next came the bacon mac n cheese appetizer we ordered, YUM! They bake the appetizer's individually so they come out with a nice layer of crunch on the top. Next time we will be trying the hot dog mac n cheese. We also ordered sweet potato fries, the best I have ever had. They were crispy and had a delicious dipping sauce. Dinner came out next and was delicious. We all 4 purposefully ordered different items and were all 4 very happy. The portions were quite big. I ordered a chicken sandwich and thought the meat was very flavorful and not dry at all. The bun was very fresh. The french fries were delicious. They must have had some type of batter on them and were oh so yummy. We also got dessert, clearly we were treating ourselves! For desert we got one order of apple pie a la mode and one order of pumpkin bread pudding. I typically do not care for fruit pies but I devoured the apple pie, yummy. I didn't try to bread pudding but was told that it was great. 

Definitely a great place to try and go back to multiple times. Wonderful atmosphere and independently owned!",5.0,2011-03-16,0.789,0.177,0.033,263
1072,Russell P.,"Second visit to Jack's.  First visit I had the Spicey Chicken Sandwich,  it was good although more bread than chicken.  I liked the meal enough to return 2 weeks later.  Not a good move!  I ordered the turkey club and requested crispy bacon.  The sandwich came out,  bacon perfectly crisp,  but where was the turkey!  As I looked closer my wife pointed out a small spider was crawling on my sandwich.  I told the waiter who immediately took the sandwich away and placed a new order.  I don't believe the kitchen has a bug problem and this was an aberration.  But, I was extremely disappointed the owner or manager did not apologize or offer to comp my sandwich.  At the very least some gesture of an apology.  Back to the food,  my turkey club would have been good if they actually put more than a slice or two of turkey on the club sandwich.  It was more like a  BLT.....disappointed!  At least if I go to BJ's across the street,  I get what I pay for.  It will be sometime before I would consider returning if at all to Jack's unfortunately.",2.0,2011-03-11,0.574,0.333,0.093,191
1073,J G.,"Went here on a Saturday afternoon at about 5PM. Half the restaurant was empty. Waited about 10 minutes for a table. A few minutes later the Waitress came over to us and gave us the menu. Asked us if we liked anything to drink pretty promptly. We asked for a few minutes just to settle in. The service from there was rather slow and bad after that. She finally came back and ask what we wanted to drink and then left. She never asked if we wanted a appetizer. It wasn't till she took our dinner order that she asked if we wanted a appetizer. My salad and the appetizer came at the same time. Along with table bread. Way off. Never asked, if we wanted a another drink. The appetizer, we had the Jalepeño Hummus and two over Mediterranean Dips with Olive plate. Pita bread that came with it was warm. Which was good. Not much of a Jalepeño flavor though. The other two had a Citrus flavor. Could not make out the difference between them. Just the color. Overall okay. Plates were not picked up. We had to ask.  I asked for a beer. Didn't come until I was half way through my meal. And then, usually the waitress pours the beer into your glass. She didn't.  She just dropped it off without even asking if everything was okay. As for food,  I had the Petite Steak and my wife had the Thai Beef Salad. Mine came with Mashed Potatoes and Vegetable's. Overall, pretty straight forward. Good, not outstanding. Standard fair at near bye average restaurant. My wife's didn't even look Thai at all. Looked more like pre-packaged cabbage salad with the beef mixed in. Bland according to my wife. Not happy at all with it.  No Thai taste at all. She won't order again. Probably, better off trying something else next time. Might be a while. For what it is, if you like average you'll be happy. Maybe it was the service being way off that made the difference. For Food- Fair to Average, Price- Average, Service-Bad, Ambiance-Bar/Grill Tone.",3.0,2012-01-29,0.013,0.052,0.935,352

1075,Jennifer W.,"This place definitely has promise.  We came here for a quick bite to eat and an after work drink.  There was a 20 minute wait for a table, so we sauntered over to the bar and grabbed a high-top and decided to eat there.  Service was ok, but then again we were at the bar, so my expectations are a bit less.  The server did have to double check on my order, and got the fries wrong, even after he repeated the order to me.  Not too many smiles from him either, although the other waiter he had helping out was more than pleasant.  Drinks definitely need some work.  Both the julep and the Gin Cucumber cocktail were way off balanced, and I probably should have gone with my stand-by beer.  Food was decent.  My chicken sandwich with pesto was a bit bland, but was not horrible.  The hubby's burger was the same, not horrible, not fantastic, just kinda ehhh.  I do like the fact that they have some great TV's at the bar, and that this seems to be a relaxed, chill place to come and unwind after a long day.  As I mentioned above, I think this place really does have a lot of potential, and I plan on returning and trying out more options from their menu in the main dining room area.",3.0,2011-04-18,0.107,0.182,0.711,226

The ceasar salad was very fresh, however? I really think they tossed my salad with the wrong dressing... It was a sweet and sour vinaigrette that was a top my salad ... Didn't taste bad but wasn't really a Cesar. The carbonate wasn't bad, can't go wrong with pastas there really all the ones at our table looked really tasty. Carbonara was creamy and delicious .. Again can't go wrong with bacon cream cheese.. Yum the service was ok, the place has a new spacious feel but it was so loud and crowded the air got stuffy .

1080,Heather K.,"3.5 stars rounded up to 4. We stopped in for brunch today and it was pretty good. We're fans of Boulevard's breakfast (in Daly City) and I think this place is owned by the same people - the menus are really similar. I had the Elena's Omelet which was pretty tasty. I'm such a pain in the ass when ordering breakfast....substitute egg whites in my omelets, replace the taters with fruit, no butter on toast....so I'm not really ever surprised when my order is messed up. Today they forgot the fruit-tater switch, but I mentioned the discrepancy when they brought our food out and they fixed it really fast. The fruit honestly wasn't really worth it though. Just a few chunks of honeydew and cantaloupe. Boring. Oh well. The bloody mary mix is also a little bland, but not too bad. My hubby enjoyed his meal from what I can tell, but since he's a new Yelper, I'll let him comment on his own! Our server was nice but kinda spacey....I could totally picture him in a supporting role in Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure. The dining room is open and airy; I don't get the ""cafeteria feel"" that some other reviewers have mentioned. Seemed pretty clean and nice to me. Only thing I didn't like was the acoustics - it's really noisy in there!! A great place for breakfast or brunch. Looking at the dinner menu (mostly Greek stuff and very few vegetarian and healthy options) though, it doesn't really appeal to me all that much for lunch or dinner.",4.0,2011-03-13,0.587,0.352,0.061,261

I love my sunday breakfast  to have my favorite pumpkin french toast (dripping with butter), which will make you feel like your sinning because it is that good!  The bartenders are really nice to talk to when I've taken guests or clients.  My advice is, go to Jacks with company you really want to enjoy yourself with, have fun, enjoy life and what you have now and whine about what you don't have.  Leave extra room for the ice cream sunday with extra chocolate syrup, grab some extra spoons and dig in. I think you pleasantly surprise Jack's is a really is nice restaurant and the food is good.

We have only eaten dinner here a couple times, but each time, the meal was very memorable.   Everything is SO fresh, from the lettuce and ingredients of the salad, to the freshly chopped herbs in the rice pilaf, to the freshness and expertly grilled salmon that I had for my dinner.  My partner had the Salisbury steak, which was also done to perfection (they asked HOW he wanted it cooked - not something you usually expect with preparation of Salisbury Steak)  The servers and wait staff are all working to make sure everyone is satisfied and enjoying their meals.  The décor is contemporary with not too much ornamentation to take ones attention from the intent of the restaurant - FOOD, and a delicious meal it is.

We were seated in the back section with a wall partition blocking the noise from the main eating area. Didn't realize how loud it was until we left(a nice plus for being seated in bumf**k). I ordered the Spaghetti Carbonara which came out piping hot. It tasted meh. I guess I'm a snob when it comes to the Carbonara. My wife's eyes almost fell out of the sockets when she saw a section dedicated to Mac and Cheese. Seriously I had to tell her to keep it down since she kept saying ""Oooohhh"" and ""Yuuuuum"" while scanning the menu. She ordered the Bacon Mac and enjoyed it. The Calamari app was solid, but then again if you screw up Calamari you wouldn't be able to operate the McNugget maker at Mickey D's. The staff was friendly, but needs a few more weeks to settle in.

We asked the waiter, what was the most popular entree since this was our first time here and he didnt seem too knowledgeable about the menu and was no help. Then, it took an additional 20-30 minutes to get our food, which was understandable because it was really busy. Half way through our meal we got our appetizer, which was somewhat pointless seeing that we already had our meal.There were people seated after us and they managed to get their food before us. The waiter did not ask us how everything was going until he was ready to collect our payment. We asked for refills and for a to go box, and never got it! We werent catered to compared to the other people around us, who seemed to be a bit older than us, so we felt as if age was a contributor to the quality of service. The food was not all that great, I had salmon and mashed potatoes. The potatoes tasted like they were microwaved and some parts were cold and some parts were warm, not hot!

1098,deanna r.,My friend and I went here for lunch yesterday and I was not impressed.   We were seated in the booths adjacent to the bar which we didn't know meant the bar tender was our server.  Well that in and of itself was a disaster.  He showed up after a few minutes to get our drink order-- brought the drink and then we never saw him again.  We asked another server who our server was and that we had not seen him and she was the one who said it was the bar tender who by the way was serving a full bar and I think all the drinks for the entire place.  Finally the waitress took our order.  When our order arrived it was WRONG-- my friend ordered the Turkey club and got a turkey sandwich instead.  They offered to switch it but at this point we had already been there about 40 mins and had to be somewhere  at 1:15.  The food was ok-- we found out while we were waiting that the owner of Boulevard is  the brother of the owner of Jacks--  Once we had gotten our food and were eating and talking the waitress came over to see if we wanted boxes for our food-- we were not even really done-- talk about feeling rushed out!!!  I think there was a man walking around who was the manager and our waitress knew we were not happy you would have thought we would have gotten a visit from the manager-- NO-- So from sitting at 12pm and getting out of there at 1:10 when tables that were seated after us had there food before us and turning the table over again for other diner SO needless to say I will NEVER go back-- good luck Jacks if you are starting out like this your days may be numbered!!,1.0,2011-03-26,0.014,0.075,0.912,311
